            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO ALL ENGLISH Catholicks, that are faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to Queene ELIZABETH, <hi>our most dread Soueraigne: The</hi> Secular Prieſts that are diuerſly afflicted, doe wiſh all proſperitie, iuſtice, peace, ioy, and happines in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T cannot be vnknowne vnto you all (very reuerend and deere Catholicks) what great and bitter contention (raiſed vp from hell no doubt through the malignitie of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than) hath lately fallen out amongſt vs, who are your ſpirituall guides, and ought to haue beene vnto you examples of humilitie, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, vnitie, pietie, and a whole ſchoole of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious vertues. And we are fully perſwaded, that the conſideration of it, doth very greatlie moue &amp; perplex your catholick harts with manifold griefes: eſpecially, ſeeing we are on both ſides ſo confident in our owne ſo contrarie courſes.</p>
            <p>The Ieſuits ſay vnto vs: <hi>Woe be to that man, by whom the ſcandale commeth:</hi> We the ſecular Prieſts, ſay vnto them; <hi>Woe be vnto him by whom the ſcandale commeth.</hi> Now whether they apply the words of our Sauiour Chriſt more rightly to vs, or we to them, therein ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the doubt, and that is the difficultie: Wee both doe pleade for our ſelues: and you with the Church; muſt iudge betwixt vs both as vmpiers of our cauſe. The woe is of a large extent, &amp; will be too heauie to be vndergone by any. <hi>Expedit ei,</hi> (as the text ſaith) <hi>it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, or farre better it were</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>for ſuch a man, that a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were hanged about his necke, and he drowned in the bottom of the Sea.</hi> In ſuch a contrary application of this ſo terrible a woe, you (our auncient children and faithfull Catholicks) ſhall ſhewe your ſelues right worthie of theſe honourable titles, and greatly benefit both vs the Secular prieſts, and the others the eſteemed religious Ieſuits, to
<pb facs="tcp:14558:3"/>the preuenting in part of this heauie cenſure; if you continue ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the doctrine which you haue receiued of vs, conioyned in one a like vnitie of fayth, hope and charitie; and ſhall take no offence at theſe our quarrells &amp; vnbrotherly garboyles. For as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith; <hi>Qui ſcandalizatur parvulus est: He that is ſcandalized is but a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Maiores enim ſcandala non accipiunt: ſound and reſolute Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks doe not take ſcandale at anything.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was long ſince an earneſt diſputation amongſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>who among them ſhould be greater:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> &amp; Chriſt himſelfe was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by them as vmpire and Iudge paramount to determine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. Who accordingly hearing the matter, propounded vnto him in theſe wordes: <hi>Quis putas maior eſt &amp;c: who thinkeſt thou is greater?</hi> decided their iarre, with ſome ſharpneſſe in this ſort as the text reporteth. <hi>Ieſus calling vnto him a little child, ſet him in the midst of them and ſaid: Amen I ſay vnto you, vnleſſe you be conuerted and become as children,</hi> (that is ſaith <hi>Lyra</hi> in the gloſſe vppon that place) <hi>vnleſſe you be couerted ab elatione ſcil: ſuperbiae et ambitione maiorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, from pride and ambitious affectation of greatnes, and become hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſimple without malice or gall of ſinne, you ſhall neuer enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> And furthermore, foreſeeing in his diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, how ſuch contention for ſuperioritie might proue verie dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the Church, and wound the tender conſciences of manie weake nouices in the catholicke faith: this moſt wiſe Arbitrator <hi>(in whom be all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge bid)</hi> doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his commination to the better ſuppreſsing of that ſo dangerous an enormitie: ſaying, <hi>Hee that ſhall ſcandalize one of theſe little ones, that beleeue in me, it is expedient for him that a Milſtone be hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, and that he be drowned in the depth of the ſea.</hi> Vppon which words the ſaid <hi>Lyra</hi> writeth in this manner, <hi>Et ſi hoc generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dicit contra omnes: tamen hic ſpecialiter contra Apoſtolos, qui hic de dignitate vide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur contendere, et in hoc poterant alios perdere: Although Chriſt ſpeaketh theſe words generally to all: yet he ſpeaketh them heere ſpecially against his Apostles, who doe ſeeme to contend here for digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and therein might haue ouerthrowne many a ſoule no doubt, and harmeleſſe hart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe things wee haue thought good to put you that be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks in minde; that thereby you may conſider how the chiefeſt ſeruaunts and children of God haue beene ſubiect to this ambitious humour of affecting ſoueraigntie, and ſeeking for ſuperioritie, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and precedencie. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, (though otherwiſe a worthie Prelate in the church of God) did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende for the ſupremacie with Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> that peereleſſe paſtor, prince, prelate, and pope of Rome. And heere at home it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to thoſe that haue read or heard our Engliſh hiſtories, what ſtirre and hart-burning there hath beene in former times, betwixt the
<pb facs="tcp:14558:3"/>Archbiſhops of Canterburie and Yorke about ſuch matters, being in other reſpects all of them verie notable men. But neuer was there ſuch an attempt in our opinions for ſuperioritie amongſt Catholiques, (for wee will not at this time meddle with any heretiques) ſince the firſt preaching of the Goſpell of Chriſt, as now lately is ſet on foot vnhappily by the Ieſuits miſchieuous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Their order is declared by <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> to be the fifth order, <hi>Mendicantium predicatorum, Of the begging Preachers or Friers. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> their founder, pretended to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called <hi>Fratres minimi, The loweſt, leaſt, or meaneſt ſort of Friers:</hi> and termed this company,<note place="margin">Io. Oſorus obitu Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natij.</note> 
               <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etatem minimam, The meaneſt or leaſt Societie:</hi> not in regard that they were few in number at the firſt: but as a great Ieſuit ſaith, <hi>To ſignifie thereby, that his Societie ſhould yeeld honour to all other ſorts of religious perſons as to their elder brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ac plane patribus, &amp; as indeed to their Fathers.</hi> But tell vs we pray you; haue theſe Minimes &amp; begging Friers taken this courſe? We wiſh with all our harts they had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.</p>
            <p>That the Apoſtles before they were fully inſtructed by the holy Ghoſt, ſhould haue contended amongſt themſelues, who ſhould be the greateſt, being euerie one of them in ſo high fauour with their Maiſter Chriſt, as they were: it might haue admitted ſome tollerable excuſe, had not our Sauiours <hi>Woe</hi> beene mentioned in the Scriptures, and denounced plainly againſt them, as a dreadful doome by a ſharpe cenſure of a ſorrowfull clauſe. There wanted not ſome probable pretences; why Patriarches and Archbiſhops might grow into variable oppoſitions for the prerogatiues of their places, themſelues being perſonages by calling of ſome equalitie. But that the meaneſt, leaſt, and loweſt order of begging Friers ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, not among themſelues who ſhould be the greateſt: but with their elder brethren, auncients and fathers, the moſt Reuerenced, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and Religious perſons of euerie profeſsion: and not that onely, but ouer and beſides all this, to ſtriue to bring vnder their girdles the Secular Cleargy, the chiefe ſtate of Prieſtly preheminency is a wonder as we thinke, the like whereof was neuer heard before amongſt Catholiques, Eccleſiaſticall, Religious or Temporall, ſince Chriſts time till of late daies, that the Ieſuits are growne to ſuch a ſtubborne and vnbridled head, as we feare will breed great miſchiefe in the Church of God, before they be well reformed and brought into order againe.</p>
            <p>In the other contentions before mentioned, there was no fault as we takeit, eyther in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> for defending his ſupremacie, or in Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great, for mayntaining the dignitie of the Sea Apoſtolique: or yet in the Archbiſhops of Canterburie, for ſtanding vpon their right and intereſt, granted before vnto them by ſundrie of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, for the chiefe primacy in and ouer the Church and eccleſiaſticall State in England; but in thoſe that ſought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
<pb facs="tcp:14558:4"/>them, was all the offence that was committed. And that is our caſe iuſt: who being Secular Prieſts now in England and elſe-where, doe ſtand at this preſent in a ſtrong oppoſition againſt the Ieſuits. We labour not for any extraordinarie ſuperioritie ouer them, not emulate in euill ſenſe any of their vertues or good inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours (if any happily be in them:) nor intrude our ſelues into their harueſt, nor prie into their actions more then we are compelled, nor inſinuate our ſelues into their fauours, nor deſire to haue any dealing at all with them. Onely we would be glad to keepe our owne pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Church of Chriſt, (which we and all our predeceſſors Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſts haue euer held, ſince the firſt propagation of the Goſpell of Chriſt and Chriſtian Catholique faith and religion, by the holy Apoſtles after our Sauiours aſcenſion:) and that now theſe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Friers by faction and falſe pretences might not tyranniſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange to conſider how mightily they are poſſeſſed, with pride and ambition, and how farre they haue thereby preuailed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of learning, they ſcorne to be ſubiect to the orders of any Vniuerſitie: being preachers, they will be exempted from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolement of all or any Biſhops: being Friers, you kill them, if you tell them of any cloyſters, or wiſh them to liue retired like right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men indeed, or to keepe the generall ſtatutes and rules of all other religious orders. Being naturall borne ſubiects in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they remayne, no ciuill Magiſtrate, Prince, or Potentate, muſt controll them, nor once ſeeme to call them to the leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for any of their proceedings. And that which is moſt, being men that profeſſe ſuch zeale, charitie, &amp; inward mortification, ſuch humilitie and godlines: Nay, being men forfooth of perfection (<hi>Eſt enim hoc inſtitutum viroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plane perfectorum: this our inſtitution,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn Oſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> as the ſaid Ieſuit ſaith: <hi>is of ſuch men as are indeed perfect:</hi>) they refuſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to accompanie the reſt of the Cleargie both Secular Regular, and religious, and the whole Church of God in one of her moſt ſoleme and publique ſeruices done to his diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, which we call our great and ſolemne proceſsions: becauſe that by the cuſtome of the Church, they being the youngeſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, or minimes of all Mendicants or begging Friers, were to haue come laſt behind all the reſt in that moſt honourable ſeruice.</p>
            <p>But to come to our ſelues, &amp; to their affectation of ſuperioritie ouer vs, and that in theſe diſmal daies, &amp; in the middeſt of our other domeſticall calamities. The Romane Colledge, for the bringing vp of ſtudents to become Prieſts for England, was no ſooner erected, but by ſleights and falſe calumniations, they got the ſuperioritie and gouernement of it. Vpon their comming into England, how they laboured to creepe into mens conſciences: to inſinuate themſelues into Nobles and great perſons eſtates, and to diſcredit vs, many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques

            <p>There are alſo diuers other Pidgeons of this flight, that out of queſtion eyther haue galles, or ſome other verie bitter matter in them, that is equiualent to any gall whatſoeuer: Frier <hi>Holthy</hi> in his long and tedious letter to a verie vertuous Catholique Ladie written againſt vs: Frier <hi>Garnet</hi> in ſundrie of his letters both to ſome of vs, and alſo to others: Alſo Frier <hi>Parſons</hi> in his late Apologie: but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in his (as we take it) laſt booke intituled: <hi>A manifestation of the great folly, and bad ſpirit of certaine Secular Prieſts, &amp;c.</hi> Some little taſte we will giue you heere of theſe good Fathers mortified humour and verie meeke ſpirit, out of the ſaid laſt booke. You haue heard the title of it: whereunto that the whole diſcourſe might be ſutable, he inſinuateth directly in this preface, <hi>That we are in a ſort poſſeſſed with many wicked ſpirits.</hi> And to ſeeme to
<pb facs="tcp:14558:7"/>haue ſome authoritie for it: hee applieth theſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt vnto vs, where he ſaith thus. <hi>The vncleane ſpirit went forth, &amp; brought with him ſeuen other ſpirits more wicked then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all entring, dwelt there: and the ending of thoſe men was worſe then the beginning.</hi> Of ſixe of theſe diuels the chiefe ſubſtance of all his booke doth conſiſt; and therefore he nameth them direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before he commeth to his diſcourſe, and ſetteth them downe in expreſſe words. for the contents of his treatiſe. Wherein his whole drift is, to ſlaunder more honeſt men then himſelfe, and to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leade and ſeduce you: as though whatſoeuer the Secular Prieſts haue written, in ſuch bookes, as they haue beene inforced this yeere paſt to publiſh, for their owne iuſt defence againſt the Ieſuits calumniations, and bad dealings with them, did proceed onely from their folly: accompanied alwaies with one of theſe ſixe lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. For example, and to vſe his owne words: <hi>From their manifest folly &amp; bad ſpirit: from their folly &amp; paſsionate ſpirirt: from their folly and preſumptuous ſpirit: from their folly and vnſhamefaſt ſpirit: from their folly and malignant ſpirit, and from their folly and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſpirit.</hi> With this folly and theſe ſixe wicked ſpirits, he raiſeth vp tempeſts againſt vs by Sea and land, and playeth the Exorciſt: in ſuch ſort throughout his whole diſcourſe: as if hee had beene Frier <hi>Weston</hi> (another Pidgeon of the ſame Doue-coate) at Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, when the time was (whereof wee feare a ſtraunge rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and ſo dealeth with our ſaid brethren, as though eyther hee himſelfe or they (good men) were diuels indeed. And ſhall wee ſay that this man hath no gall in him, but in mildneſſe of his ſpeech and ſimplicitie of his heart is like a Doue? Hee that ſhall with anie iudgement read his ſaid treatiſe, will rather thinke he was brought vp in a Crowes-neſt. Some men are much deceiued, if both he and many of his crue: might not for their ſtinging and poyſoned writings, be better reſembled to Hornets and Dragons, then to ſo milde a fowle as a Doue is reported to be, by all that write of her.</p>
            <p>But certaine perſons will ſay vnto vs: you ſee not that part of the wallet that hangs at your owne backes. It is true, that wee are not ignorant how greatly ſome of our ſaid brethren are blamed, and Maiſter <hi>Watſon</hi> chiefely by many of you (how iuſt ſoeuer their cauſe bee) for the bitterneſſe of their ſtile; and we wiſh with all our hearts, that they had tempered their pennes better, not in reſpect of the Ieſuits, but of your weakenes. God forgiue vs all our ſinnes. <hi>In multis enim offendimus omnes: For in many things wee offend all. Si quis in verbo non offendit hic perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt vir: If any offend nor in his ſpeeches, he is a perfect man.</hi> But yet ſome further defence may be made of our brethrens ſaid bitternes: mens generall imperfections alwaies conſidered, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we often ſtayne euen our beſt actions.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14558:7"/>
            <p>It muſt bee confeſſed by all men that are of any vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that ſharpeneſſe eyther of ſpeech or ſtyle, is not alwaies to bee diſliked. The olde Prophets, Chriſt himſelfe, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, many holy Saints and Fathers; haue vſed this kind of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes and ſharpe writing when they ſaw cauſe. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe much might be alleadged, as alſo to ſhewe that oftentimes, wounds are better then kiſſes, fretting tents, coraſiues, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions, more needfull then gentle, milde, lenitiue, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haſtie skinning plaiſters. So as hereof there being no queſtion amongſt vs, or any other of diſcretion: the doubt then is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ieſuits or we haue the better cauſe: and conſequently, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vs may better pretend the teſtimonie of Gods Spirit, a good conſcience, true zeale, perfect charitie, and the practiſe of Chriſt, of his Apoſtles, and of many auncient fathers, for the ſharpenes of our writings.</p>
            <p>Maiſter <hi>Parſons</hi> ſpeaketh (in his ſaid manifeſtation) of his owne long and accuſtomed practiſe and experience: where he ſaith: <hi>That an euill argument may ſometimes by cunning and ſmooth handling, or by ſhewing wit &amp; learning, of zeale or modeſty, be made plauſible to the vulgar Reader.</hi> And indeed therein he hath an eſpeciall gift aboue all men that we know. For no mans writings are generally more ſpightfull and galling then his. But it is mixt with ſuch ſtoods of Crocodils teares, when he guirdeth moſt, as that, he then alwaies pretendeth ſuch deuotion and charitie, as though euerie hard word he vſeth, went to his verie heart: and that hee would not deale ſo roughly with any of his brethren for his life, were it not, that (for their good and amendement) hee were driuen thereunto of meere neceſſitie. And with theſe fayre pretences, the ſimpler ſort are greatly blinded. But by his leaue, it is alſo as certain, that if a true cauſe be cleerely and at the full deliuered, although it be done with no ſuch hypocritical skill, but with ſome choller and heat of humour (as zeale ſometime is tearmed:) he is but likewiſe a verie vulgar Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and of a ſhallow reach, that will therefore be led to diſcredit the truth vpon ſo light a ground. Men of ſound iudgement will alwaies looke to the iſſue of the matter in queſtion, and not to the manner of pleading. More therefore of the cauſe it ſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon this doubt before mentioned doth ariſe. Wee hope we may truly ſay it, as in the ſight of God, and without all phariſaical oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we are not ambitious: that we ſeeke no exemptions from our lawfull ſuperiour: that we honour diſcipline and embrace it: that we craue to haue Biſhops to ouer-ſee, puniſh, &amp; control vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we doe amiſſe: and that we labour chiefly in theſe diſaſtrous quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, to withſtand ſo great an innouation &amp; general diſgrace to all the Seculer Cleargie in Chriſtendome, as neuer yet hapned, if we ſhould yeeld to be at the checke and direction either of Frier <hi>Garnet,</hi> Frier
<pb facs="tcp:14558:8"/>
               <hi>Parſons,</hi> or any, or all the Ieſuits in the world. And wee are the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo earneſt againſt both them and their plottings to this purpoſe: becauſe we likewiſe know their further practiſes and moſt wicked deſignements, againſt both our Prince and country, &amp; how they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with the Spaniards, her Maieſties profeſſed enemies. So as might the Ieſuits once beare rule ouer al both Prieſts &amp; people (as let the ſtate look to it in time, for they haue further preuailed here in alreadie then we are glad of:) it would not be long before this kingdom were brought into a general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>buſtion. Is our cauſe then ſo iuſt, and theirs ſo impious, and ſhould we be ſilent? Doe they ſay vnto vs with <hi>Tobias</hi> the Ammonite: <hi>That do what you can, a Foxe ſhall be able to ouerthrow all your oppoſition:</hi>

Heare vs O our God, heare vs: and becauſe they doe deſpiſe vs and our endeuours, to maintayne both the Church and our countrey againſt their machinations, giue them ouer that they may be a deſpiſed and contemptible generation throughout all the world if in time they repent not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can any true harted Engliſh Catholick, ſeeing how the caſe nowe ſtandeth betwixt vs and theſe men, be iuſtly offended with this our zeale? Hath God made vs annoynted prieſts here amongſt you, <hi>and ſhal we ſee a ſword drawne out againſt this Land, and not ſounde out our trumpet to ſumon you to battell?</hi> One telleth you verie plainlie in his Latine Appendix (and we ſuppoſe it is our R. Arch-prieſt him ſelfe) <hi>that Cardinall Allen and Father Parſons, as Moſes and Ioſue, iam diu proculdubio occupaſſent promiſſionis terram: had long ſince out of doubt poſſeſſed this Realme of England: niſi quorundam inobedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia atque ingratiſſimum obſtitiſſet murmur: had not the diſobedience of ſome, and theyr most diſpleaſing murmuring hindred it.</hi> It is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Engliſh Ieſuits, and of ſuch as are Ieſuited, neuer to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Frier <hi>Parſons</hi> trecheries, but they ioyne that good Cardinall with him, to mittigate the odiouſnes of his proceedings. But howe coulde they haue gotten this land of Promiſe into their fingers? Meane they by their attempt 1588? or had they before this time layd violent hands vpon her Maieſtie? or what had they elſe doone, if ſome ſuch impediment as they ſpeake of had not hapned? Bleſſed was that diſobedience, and happy was that murmuring, that deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this kingdome from ſuch vncatholick and moſt trayterous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignements. Rather content your ſelues deere Catholicks to goe &amp; dwell in Babilon: then euer ſeeke to obtaine the Land of Canaan by ſuch cruell, barbarous, and Turkiſh ſtratagems. Are not ſuch Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its or perſons whatſoeuer Ieſuited, worthy to be deteſted, that dare publiſh their diſlike of ſuch diſobedience and murmure, as hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
<pb facs="tcp:14558:8"/>ſuch a Chaos of all miſchiefes, as the conquering of our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle land of promiſe would haue brought with it? Or if we haue been too ſharpe in our encountering of the Gyants (as they falſly terme vs) are we not to be excuſed?</p>
            <p>And as wee woulde haue you to iudge of vs and the reſt of our brethren, that whatſoeuer they haue written, it proceeded of theyr loue and zeale both to our Church and Countrie: ſo our hartie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, that you would thinke and iudge the like of thoſe right zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Catholicks of other Countries, that haue written againſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in the like reſpect, much more ſharply then any of our brethren hetherto haue done. For howe highlie ſoeuer the Ieſuits are yet in our bookes, becauſe you know them not throughlie: yet are they alreadie become an odious generation in manie places. In the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Swecia, their verie names are deteſted. The Cleargie of Spayne is in great diſlike of them. The religious men generallie in all countries doe hate them. At this inſtant, there is a great &amp; moſt dangerous contention in particuler, betwixt them and the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, about a ſpeciall point of grace. At their firſt attempt to come into Fraunce, it was fore-ſeen by the graue Sorboniſts of Paris, what miſchiefe they would work if they were admitted there. Afterwards, they crept into that countrie like Foxes by little and little, and ſo in proceſſe of time behaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, as not long ſince they haue been baniſhed thence, as men of moſt pernitious, wicked, and dangerous conuerſation. You haue heard in a word or two, out of <hi>Oſorius</hi> the Spaniard, what the Ieſuits thinke of themſelues: it woulde make a large volume to recount the praiſes which they haue elſe-where hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vppon their founder, their ſocietie, &amp; their fellowes; according as the ſaying is: Claw me and I will claw thee. You alſo vnderſtand as well by the premiſes, as by our bretherens ſeuerall treatiſes, what eſtimation we haue of them, and ſome haue beene offended vvith them for their plainenes therein. But now wee humbly intreate you to obſerue, howe roundly they haue beene taken vp in Fraunce for halting, by men of no ſmall credite in that State; for theyr yeres ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie auncient, for their experience verie wiſe, and for their ſoundnes in the Catholicke Romane religion, neuer impeached by any but Ieſuits, who condemne all men eyther for Newters or ſchiſmaticks, or hereticks, or at the leaſt for cold and luke-warme Catholicks, that diſcloſe their impieties.</p>

They are a vvicked
<pb facs="tcp:14558:9"/>race, borne to the ruine &amp; deſolation of mankinde. In their fourth vowe to their Generall, they goe thus farre, that in him they muſt acknowledge Chriſt preſent, as it were, If Ieſus Chriſt ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to goe and kill, they muſt doe ſo. The Generall of the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its is alwayes a Spanyard, and choſen by the King of Spayne. <hi>Loyola</hi> their firſt Generall was a Spanyard, <hi>Laynes</hi> the ſecond a Spanyard alſo. The third, <hi>Euerardus,</hi> was a Fleming, a ſubiect of the King of Spayne. <hi>Borgia,</hi> the fourth, was a Spanyard. <hi>Aquauiua</hi> the fift, now liuing, is a Neopolitane, ſubiect to the King of Spayne. If their Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Generall commaund them to murther, or cauſe the King of Fraunce to be murthered, they muſt of neceſſity do it. They ſhoote at no other matter, but to eſtabliſh the tyrannie of Spaine in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. All the Ieſuits in the world, are bound to pray for the King of Spayne, and that once a day, as his affayres doe require. They haue ſtirring fellowes to be placed in all quarters, to execute whatſoeuer may tend to the good and aduauncement of Spayne. They had no other marke during the warres in Fraunce: but to make the King of Spaine Monarch ouer all Chriſtendome. The common prouerbe of theſe hypocrits is: one God, one Pope: and one king of Spaine, the great King catholick and vniuerſall. All their thoughts, all their purpoſes, all their Sermons, all their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsions, haue no other white they ayme at, but to bring all Europe vnder the ſubiection of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh gouernment. The Ambaſſadour of Fraunce, when hee was in Spayne and Italie, neuer found matter of weight wherein they had not an oare. There was neuer Letter intercepted during the warres, wherein there was anie pernicious point, but a Ieſuits ſinger was in it. In their confeſsions and without witneſſes, they paint not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but the harts of their ſchollers, with the tincture of Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their princes and naturall Soueraignes.</p>

               <hi>Mathew</hi> a Ieſuit, was the principal inſtrument of the League 1585.

            <p>As long as the Ieſuits remaine in Fraunce, the king of Spaines murtherers, may be exhorted, confeſſed, houſled and incouraged.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout two yeeres agoe departing from Paris, wee met by chuance vpon the fieldes with ſixe in a company that traueld our way: ſome of them had been at Rome, ſome at Venice. When we had iournied eyght daies together our horſes wearie, one of our conſorts told vs, there dwelt a Gentleman not farre of, an olde acquaintance of his, who doubtleſſe would eſteeme of it as a great honour done vnto him, if (vpon occaſion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to refreſh our ſelues) we would goe viſite him. How ſoeuer ſome diſtaſled this aduiſe at the firſt, yet at laſt the moſt voyces caried it, and all of vs forth-with turned out of our way vnto his houſe, where we found him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many other Gentlemen. Who eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his auncient friend, gaue him many cheerefull em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings, and ſaid; How commeth it to paſſe, that I am ſo fortunate, as to behold my ſecond ſelfe this day? Sir, at a word you are very welcome, and I thinke my ſelfe deeply indebted to you, for this vnexpected aſſault, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me with ſo fayre a troupe.</p>
               <p>After we had ſeuerally thanked him one by one, hee commaunded our horſes to be ſet vp, and a cup of wine

                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:16"/>to be brought vs, and ſo led vs through the Court into his houſe: vvhere entertayning one another with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeable greetings, hee gaue order for Supper to be ready in conuenient time, that wee might take our reſt: meane-while wee fell into diſcourſe. But as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it hapneth, that we lay our hand vpon that part of our body that grieves vs moſt; ſo wee begun princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to complaine of the miſeries of Fraunce, brought in amongſt vs by diuerſitie of Religion, euery man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to aduaunce, what himſelfe maintaines ſutably to his owne priuate paſsion, which he calls deuotion.</p>
               <p>There was a Ieſuite in our company diſguiſd in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, a man (without queſtion) very ſociable: There was an Aduocate alſo, whom I well perceiued to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Bulles, conſtitutions, and orders of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites. The ſpeech when we parleyd, rebounding from mouth to mouth, the Ieſuite made demonſtration, how much our Church is bounde vnto theyr ſocietie. And belieue me Gentlemen (quoth he) if God had not ſent amongſt vs our good Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and his company, our Catholique religion had been extinguiſht: but as it commonly falls out, that in puniſhing our offences, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter GOD hath afflicted a Country with ſome generall plague, he applies a remedie to it againe, that it may not be vtterly deſtroied: ſo hauing ſuffered <hi>Martin Luther</hi> to infect many Nations with his poyſon, it pleaſed him (for the cauſe before alleaged) to raiſe vp another <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Church, to preſerue the head thereof, from all the venomous bitings of that Monſter. And to ſpeak what I thinke, I am of that mind, that <hi>Ignace Loyhola,</hi> had his name giuen him, not by chaunce, but by miracle, to this end no doubt, that by changing one Letter into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>C.</hi> into <hi>R.</hi> calling him <hi>Ignare Loyhola,</hi> for <hi>Ignace Loyhola,</hi> all poſteritie might knowe him to be the man, which had made an end of <hi>Luthers</hi> ignorance, and of all his followers, which vppon his grounds ſhould ſet anie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14558:16"/>other hereſies abroach heereafter.</p>
               <p>At this ſpeech of his, euery man began to ſmile, for it was deliuered with ſo good a grace, as it could not be offenſiue to any, vnleſſe the Aduocate, vvho vvith change of countenaunce ſayd thus vnto him. Sir, I will not ſuffer your ſpeech to fall to the ground without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it vp againe. I would faine knowe what miracles the Ieſuits haue wrought; what bounds they haue ſet to bridle the courſe of hereſie; and what difference there hath beene in the carriage of the one and the other? For if the Hugonotes on the one ſide, were the cauſe of the troubles in Fraunce, in the yere 1561. ſtanding as they did vpon their defence; the Ieſuite on the other ſide aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayling vs, in the yeere 1565. rayſd vp farre more fierce and great tyrannies than the former. As for your newe Anagram, you abuſe your ſelfe. <hi>Ignace</hi> was in ſome good ſort a Gentleman of Nauarre, not called <hi>Ignace Loyhola,</hi> but <hi>Ignare de Loyhola,</hi> as much to ſay, as <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Law, hold thy peace.</hi> For beeing as ignorant as might be, he thought it better to be ſilent than to ſpeak. VVhich warily acknowledging in himſelfe, hee neuer ſhewed his wit in preaching, teaching or writing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were at firſt within the gates of Rome, where hee taught young children theyr beliefe, as Maiſters of pety Schooles are wont to doe.</p>
               <p>This ſpeech mooued no leſſe laughter than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: then ſaid the Gentleman our hoſte. I ſee no great matter of laughter heere; &amp; turning him to the Ieſuite, I belieue Sir (quoth hee) that you are of the Societie of IESVS, the tenour of your ſpeech bewraies no leſſe. To this the other aunſwered, that it was ſo indeed, and theyr order permitted them to be diſguiſd, the better to ſound euery man in his humor. I am very glad of thys ſaid the Gentleman, and I doe belieue, that ſome good Angell led you hether into my houſe, the rather for that I haue beene long time deſirous of ſuch good company,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:17"/>to the end I might know how the caſe ſtands with your Order, which I ſee is balanced betweene two Scales, greatly commended of ſome, and by the ſame weights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine much blamed of others. But ſeeing there is no banquet heere for ſeruaunts, they ſhall take away the cloth, and thanks giuen to God for his daily bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, wee will enlarge our ſelues with thys poynt a little farther. It was performed as hee had ſayd, and all the wayters voyded the place, he deſired the Ieſuite not to be diſpleaſed, if after the manner of a Catechiſme, he brought in one like a childe, moouing the queſtion to his Maiſter, for the better vnderſtanding of his firſt grounds. In this manner dealt the Gentleman with the Ieſuite, deſirous to be informed of the principall points of his Order, whereunto the Ieſuite readily conſented. And although in very deed, for any thing I coulde ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by theyr talke, the Gentleman was as skilfull as the Ieſuite: yet playing <hi>Sacrates</hi> part, he rode after him like a <hi>Platonist,</hi> to draw from him that which hee deſired, in ſuch manner as heere enſues.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> 
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou ſay you are a Ieſuite, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a newe Religious Order. <hi>Ieſuit.</hi> Nay, rather of a moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and for this cauſe haue we taken vpon vs the holy name of the ſocietie of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> as imitators beyond others, of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. <hi>Gent.</hi> You preach &amp; teach freely euery one that will heare you. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> We doe ſo. <hi>Gent.</hi> But tell me then, did the Apoſtles teach little boyes theyr Grammer, or A.B.C.? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> No. <hi>Gent.</hi> Then haue you great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14558:17"/>of them, and it is not without ſome ground, that deſpiſing the name of Chriſtians, by which they were called, you particularly terme your ſelues Ieſuites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Had they taught as wee doe, their charitie had beene more compleat, and as for the name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, wee take it to bee too proude a ſtile. <hi>Gent.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what there is, whereby you paſſe them in charitie and humilitie. You make three vowes, do you not? of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, Pouertie, and Obedience? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Neuer doubt of that. <hi>Gent.</hi> Then are you Monkes. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> By no meanes, but rather Religious men. <hi>Gent.</hi> Then your houſes be Monaſteries. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Nothing leſſe, wee call our habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Colledges, wherein wee haue our Churches. <hi>Gent.</hi> What kinde of Cabale is this, that theſe men, who make ordinary vowes that binde them to their office, as other Religious perſons doe, yet ſcorne thoſe holy names of Monkes and Monaſteries, which all venerable antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath honoured with ſo much deuotion? Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you ſhould haue cald your Colledges Gods hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

                  </gap> feare nothing ſo much as to be poore. VVell, let vs goe on, you weare a Frook as Monkes doe, you dwell in Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters like other Religious men, doe you not? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> We know not what Cloyſters meane, we ſhunne them as a Iakes, which we would be loath to come into; and wee are apparreld not as Monks, but as Secular Priſtes. It is true, that by our firſt inſtitution we faſtned a hoode to our long robes, ſometime with a point, ſomtime vvith a claſpe, but we quickly left it off againe, after our cauſe was pleaded, in the yeere 64. againſt the Vniuerſitie of Paris: For the Heretiques ſaide, our claſpe was a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooke, to catch ſilly peoples goods. And other more impudent then they, reported we did were a point, like the women of the Greene Caſtle of Toloſa.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14558:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> I could wiſh, for the honour I beare you, that you had not renewed the remembrance of thoſe olde complaints that were made againſt you. Let vs leaue thoſe bad ſpeeches to blacke mouthes, and ſuffer vs in good ſort to vnderſtand what belongs vnto your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For I deſire nothing more, than to ſee you in good conuerſation towards euery man. Although beeing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons, you refuſe the name &amp; habite outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertayning vnto Monkes, yet I doubt not, but for that which is interior, touching Faſtes and abſtinence from certaine meates, practiſd by other Religious men for the taming of the fleſh, you obſerue theſe very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Quite contrary, for we are expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by our Statutes ſo to doe, but it is left free to euerie mans deuotion, wherein is the greater merrit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> there is ſome meaning in this, for hee that ſhould leaue the Lent arbitrarie to euery man, might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe, it would bring in great diſorders: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore among other Religious perſons, the firſt Founders haue beene euer carefull to prouide for this in chiefe, iudging a generall law better than the particuler will of any one or other Religious perſon whoſoeuer. But to proceede, what ſay you to Proceſſions, vvhich the Church hath in all antiquitie much regarded (for as it appeares, they were in vſe in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time) I hope therefore you would not exempt your ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> We are ſo farre from approouing them, that on the contrary our Conſtitutions forbid vs to be there, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the Conſtitutions afterward authorized by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> You are not then as I take it of the body of the Vniuerſitie of Paris? but if you had been matricula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as you deſired in the yere 64. would you haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne your ſelues from the profeſſions of the Rector, where the foure Orders of begging Friers, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men are preſent? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> We would. <hi>Gent.</hi> Well
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14558:18"/>then, tell mee, If ſuch a ſollemne Proceſsion ſhould be made in Paris, as wee ſee, when they goe to Saint <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiefes</hi> ſhrine to appeaſe Gods wrath, when all the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, Monaſteries, and high Courts alſo be there, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on with an infinite number of the Common-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, would ye not goe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> No. <hi>Gent.</hi> Make you ſo ſmall account of the counſell of Trent? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, as of that where-vppon ſtands the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our whole Order, manger all our enemies. <hi>Gent.</hi> Know you not what is preciſely ſet downe there, that as well Secular Prieſts, as Regulers, and all ſorts of Monkes cald to publique Proceſſions, are enioyned to goe; they onely excepted, which liue in ſome ſtraighter incloſure then the reſt? Sure, you are not within the compaſſe of this exception, for in my oppinion, it is made for the Charter-houſe-Monkes, and Celeſtines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſ.</hi> I conceiue it ſo, but you muſt likewiſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> diſpenſed with vs, in the yeere 1576. to the preiudice of that Counſell, and that not onely by forme of diſpenſation, but by three expreſſe prohibitions. <hi>Gent.</hi> And yet, before this diſpenſation, you neuer kept them company, whereuppon doe you ground your priuiledge?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Vppon a perſwaſion that one day wee ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. <hi>Gent.</hi> Diſeaſd horſes in one ſtable are put a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are you in that ranke among religious men? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you tell me, euen by way of confeſſion, why were thoſe prohibitions made for you? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Becauſe you coniure mee by the holy name of Confeſſion, I will not lie to you. Some one of our Superiors, foiſted into Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> Bulls, that it was to this end, to wit; that vvee might not be hindered in preaching, reading, &amp; taking confeſſions: but to ſpeake the truth, ſeeing the foure Orders of Mendicants did preach, &amp; heare confeſſions, and reade Lectures in theyr houſes as well as wee, and yet forſooke not the ſaid Proceſsions: I take it to bee a
<pb facs="tcp:14558:19"/>pretence farre fet, and from the purpoſe, and that there was rather ſome other cauſe of it; namely, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the admittance of our Order, our place was to come behind, whereby we ſhould haue wronged great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the ſocietie of IESVS, which wee take to be a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatiue of all others. <hi>Gent.</hi> If it be ſo, the ſanctitie of your deuotion, is not without ſome Feauer of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Well, yet let vs goe forward. When you ſay your canonicall houres in your Churches, do you not ſing in two rankes, as wee doe in ours? Haue you not likewiſe a place appointed for the Prieſts office, which wee call the Quier, diſtinct and ſeparate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body where the people ſtay to ſay their prayers? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> To this I will not anſwer you by roate, but recite the text it ſelfe of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; <hi>Let not our Company vſe a Quier for theyr ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall houres, ſaying of Maſſe, or ſinging of other ſeruice.</hi> And if you haue well marked the Church in our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at Paris, there was no Quier at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> It may be your Law-maker meant by this, that you are ſo priuiledged, that when you pray without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or deuotion, onely with a kinde of moouing your lyps ſoftly to your ſelues, your prayers neuertheleſſe are heard of GOD, to ioyne this priuiledge to your other extraordinaries. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> You are a ſcoffer. I will tell you more, that in reſpect of Canonicall houres, we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to binde vs, to doe as other men doe, in ſinging or ſaying them out aloude, but we may mutter our prayers as ſoftly as we pleaſe. <hi>Gent.</hi> This prooues our Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to be very blunt, ſithence your deuout ſoules cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate diuine ſeruice now, altogether of another faſhion, beyond the practiſe of antiquitie. But what ſay you to your Aniuerſaries? doe you keepe them in fauour of your Benefactors? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Wee are very nimble at taking all that is beſtowed on vs, yet are we not thereby bound to keepe any yeerely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memorations of it. <hi>Gent.</hi> Then are you ſtarke fooles. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Not ſo, but very wiſe and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14558:19"/>deuoute: for we are not like other men, that ouercharge themſelues with long Mementoes, and are compeld to paſſe them all through with one <hi>Fidelium,</hi> as wee ſay in the common French prouerbe. To be ſhort, wee make too great a conſcience of deceiuing our Benefactors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> See heere a new Church, cleane contrarie to the old. Well, yet let vs goe forward: You tolde mee euen now, that you make three vowes, of Pouertie, Chaſtitie, and Obedience. Nowe amongſt the leaſt of many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties deuiding you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, you haue 3. vowes in ſhew co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with other religious perſons. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Our 3. vowes, varie much from theirs. <hi>Gent.</hi> Wherein? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> The firſt of our vowes is called Simple, the two other Sollemne. <hi>Gent.</hi> I beſeech you decyfer your doctrine that I may vnderſtand it, for to ſay truth, this is high Dutch to me. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> You muſt know, that in theſe three vowes, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Pouertie, Chaſtitie, and Obedience, as other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders doe: but true it is, that in the vowe Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there is a peculiar ſtreine, by meanes whereof, for ſo much and ſo long as we are there appointed, we may be maiſters of worldly goods, and take vp ſucceſſions, as well in a ſtraight line as collaterall. Moreouer, although in reſpect of a religious ſtate, it is not in any of our own powers to giue ouer our companie, yet after one hath made aboade with vs, ten twenty, or thirtie yeeres, more or leſſe, our Generall may abſolue him, and ſend him backe franke and free diſcharged from his vowe to his owne houſe, to marry if he will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> Good God, what manner of vow is this? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Such as Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath confirmed to vs. It is not ſtrange to me to finde it ſo ſtrange to you, for the great Canoniſt <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the chiefeſt of all the Doctors in matters of the Canon-law, ſpeaking of this ſimple vow, giues it the name of Great and Maruailous. <hi>Gent.</hi> He might rather haue termed it Miraculous, becauſe it lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ritches and pouertie together in one ſubiect, a thing
<pb facs="tcp:14558:20"/>impoſſible, by common courſe of nature. And that which amazeth me the more, is, that your Generall can releaſe a religious perſon when he thinkes it meet. This in our Chriſtian religion was neuer practiſed. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> None but the Ieſuits may doe it. <hi>Gent.</hi> What is your ſecond vowe which you call Sollemne, and is as I ſuppoſe the firſt of the two ſollemne ones? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Wee doe nothing in that, that doth ſmell of noueltie, more than in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: onely from the time a man enters into it, he looſeth all hope of ſucceſſion, or returne to his houſe, and is brought within co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of all other religious men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> Before we proceed to that great ſollemne vow, which is your third, I would faine learne of you ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars of your Order. Seeing you reade Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Humanitie, Phyloſophie, and Diuinitie, not onely to your owne company, but to all ſtrangers that repayre to you. I doubt not, but that ſuch as come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, are not all alike appointed to their ſtudies, for charitie begins with it ſelfe: &amp; alſo that to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prieſtes (which ſhoulde bee your intention) they muſt heare theyr courſe. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> You deceiue your ſelfe. Wee receiue an infinite company that can neither reade nor write, nor are any way fit for ſtudie afterward, nor yet to be prieſted, whom wee call Lay-brethren, appointed onely to take care of our prouiſion, when wee ſtande in neede. <hi>Gent.</hi> Theſe be voluntaries, like the Oblates, &amp; Mias-Monkes conuerts of other religious orders, which are but halfe Monkes, whom the people call Halfe-hoods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Yet you are awry. Our Lay-brethren are preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our Order, like the others as well of the vow Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as of the firſt ſollemne Vow. <hi>Gent.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, they profeſſe ignorance, like the Lay-brothers among the Friers of Italie. <hi>Jeſ.</hi> The very ſame. <hi>Gent.</hi> What a mingled religion is this, built with ſuch variety of ſtones?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14558:20"/>Bleſſed God, what would all thoſe good old Doctors ſay, whoſe ſanctimonie hath placed them in heauen, if they ſhould returne into the world againe, and ſee thys Familie ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the roſte, ouer the greateſt part of our Church? Goe to, let vs talke if you pleaſe, of the great ſollemne vowe, which is the laſt. <hi>Jeſ.</hi> That is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our worke. For in it, beſide the three ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall vowes of other religious perſons, wee make a fourth in particuler to our Father the Pope, which wee call the vowe of Miſſion, vvhereby, if it pleaſe his holineſſe to ſend vs to the Turkes, Pagans, Heretiques, or Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes to conuert them, or to bring them to the Chriſtian fayth, wee are bound to obey him without reward, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king neyther gold nor ſiluer to defray the charge of our iourney. <hi>Gent.</hi> A very pure and holy deuotion, if it be well imployed. But what true records haue you, that can giue vs ſound teſtimonie of your exployts? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Let it ſuffice you, that an account thereof is kept in Rome. When the great vowe is made, which is the very cloze of all our vowes, then we begin to be cald Fathers, a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municable to all the reſt. Yet is there ſo much humilitie among vs, that as ſoone as wee become Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we are wedded to ſo ſtrict a pouertie, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſeſſe any moueables in generall, or particular, but are bonnde to begge our reliefe from doore to doore, not by the miniſterie of brethren conuerts, as the other foure Orders of Mendicants doe, but by men of moſt note among the Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> Loe here a vowe impoſſible to be imitated. The more you are magnified aboue your fellowes, the more ſubmiſſion and pouerty you take vpon you. When you are qualefied for Ieſuits, as true imitators of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, doe you thinke the Apoſtles by profeſſion went a begging? If you be of that mind, it is an oppinion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore condemned by the Church. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Doe you take it to be euill, that from the abundance of our new zeale,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:21"/>wee ſhould adde ſome-what to theyr auncient charitie? <hi>Aduoc.</hi> This queſtion is from the purpoſe (pardon me if I interrupt you) you neuer yet ſawe a Ieſuite beare a wallet vp and downe the ſtreets. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Our ſtate is not worſe then the Foules of the ayre, which liue by the grace of God, diſtributing his Manna to euery man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, as he did in the old time to the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſraell. <hi>Gent.</hi> You pay vs with very good coyne, I accept of it ſithence you are ſo content. Doe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your ſelues within the bounds of your three vowes of Pouertie, Chaſtitie, and Obedience. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> No, for we will not like Atheiſts, diuorce ſtate affayres and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; we thinke all things ſhall goe well for the glorie of God, &amp; the ſaluation of our owne ſoules, when theſe be ioyned together. <hi>Gent.</hi> What a hotch potch of new doctrine doe you bring vs now? And to ſay the truth, neuer was any thing better ſpoken, then that wee learne of <hi>Optatus,</hi> That religion hath beene comprehended in ſtate, not ſtate in religion. Euery one of vs ſhould wiſh to haue the Gouernours of Common-weales religious, that is, men of fayth &amp; integritie, not playing with theyr conſciences to fauour theyr affaires. But for a religious Order, to manage ſtate matters, in the midſt of theyr prayers, is great irreligion, or rather hereſie. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> That which you alleage, was <hi>Optatus</hi> his oppinion, not <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> What ſay you to Saint Paule, teaching, that <hi>Nemo militans Deo, implicat ſe negotijs ſecularibus.</hi> If it be fit ſo to doe, why did you of late yeres forbid your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie to meddle therein hereafter. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> That was a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute onely for the time. For perceiuing that in the end of the yeere 93. all Fraunce was enclined to peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our expectation, wee made that conſtitution to curry fauour with the ſtate. Yet for all this, I would not haue you thinke, that wee haue here ſtakt our feete into the ground, and goe no farther. For the ſame conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14558:21"/>permit vs, to reſolue in particuler, as occaſion cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels vs. <hi>Gent.</hi> A fearefull permiſsion. But what meane you by the worde, State affayres? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> The day would be too ſhort to vtter it. Let it content you that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and ſureſt counſell we take, is of our owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which we know to be guided by the line and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our Sauiour. By this ſcrue ſomtime we remoue Kingdoms, puniſh Kings and Princes whoſe manners we miſlike, and all for the glory &amp; honour of God, and of his holy Church. <hi>Gent.</hi> All the Chriſtian vvorlde ſhould haue you in wonderfull reuerence for this, and I am ſorry you ſhould proue ſo vnthankfull now, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate ſuch a holy lawe. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> It is not ſo repeald but that it liues in our ſoules continually. For within theſe three yeeres, we practiſd to kill the Queene of England, and the Countie Maurice of Naſſau, and howſoeuer by misfortune we faild of thoſe two ſtrokes, yet we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to reach at them againe, there, and elſe where, as wee thinke good, and as opportunitie ſhall be offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gent.</hi> Then you mixe mercenary murders with ſtate matters, call you this ioyning of State &amp; Religion both together? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Why doubt you of it? Hereſie is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie whereto fire and ſword ſhould be applyed, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piriks deale with deſperate diſeaſes. <hi>Gent.</hi> You could not haue pickt out a more fit phraſe of ſpeech, than to liken your religion to Empiriks medicines, which the arte of Phiſicke condemnes. To vſe fire and ſworde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Heretique, is the Magiſtrates office, into whoſe hands God hath put the ſword, to puniſh them that are worthy to be puniſht, not yours, who as religious men are called to another function. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> What Magiſtrate dares proceede againſt Kings but we, which are inſpird with the holy Ghoſt? <hi>Gent.</hi> Is this a poynt of your firſt inſtitution? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Wee haue put in this our ſelues, by a rule of Chriſtian-good, to relieue our neighbours. And to ſhewe you with what pietie wee goe forward, when
<pb facs="tcp:14558:22"/>wee haue by our holy exhortations gaind any man of worth to execute our diſsignements, before hee depart we confeſſe him, and imploy one part of his penance to confirme him in that holy enterpriſe, wee make him heare Maſſe with deuotion; Wee miniſter the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar to him; this done, we giue him our bleſſing, for a ſure paſport to goe directly to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. VVas there euer a more ſacred and meritorious courſe than this? For to be briefe, it is in defence, and protection, of our Chriſtian Catholike Church. <hi>Gent.</hi> O chriſtian company indeed: I would be glad to learne why our Sauiour Chriſt beeing apprehended, was ſo ſore diſpleaſed with S. Peter when hee had cut off Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus eare? For at the firſt bluſh it ſeemeth that a man could not haue drawne his ſword in a quarrell of greater merit. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> You ſay well, but you doe not weigh the text. Our Sauiour did not forbid Saint Peter to betake him to his weapon, but after the blow was giuen, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to put it vp againe. <hi>Gent.</hi> Pardon mee, this aunſwere hath I know not what ſmack of Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Adde this vnto it, that S. Peter prouoked with an vndiſcreet zeale, would haue hindered a miſterie that tended to the redemption of mankind, and wee employ the ſword for the maintenaunce of the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which man-kinde would perriſh. <hi>Gent.</hi> O braue and holy expoſition, are you of opinion that this courſe is well pleaſing vnto GOD? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> None but the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques of our time euer doubted it. <hi>Gent.</hi> I am none of them, neither haue I at any time enclined ſo to be: yet I doubt much of this matter. Is there any thing in your Statutes commaunding you to goe farther? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> There is. <hi>Gent.</hi> What is that? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> We profeſſe to obey the Generall of our Order, blindfolde, (for thoſe be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of our Conſtitutions) and wee are bounde to pinne our conſciences to his ſleeue: to ſuffer him to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14558:22"/>rule vs like a boate hauing no motion, but that which they giue to it that row it: to leaue off our worke alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die begun; to obey him, and acknowledge the preſence of Ieſus Chriſt in him, as if Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded vs. <hi>Gent.</hi> Pertaines this to your Order? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> Yes I aſſure you. <hi>Gent.</hi> O admirable paradox of obedience, like that of Abraham. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> So it is. That example was euer in the mouth of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> teaching vs that obedience, is more acceptable to God then ſacrifice. <hi>Gent.</hi> O bleſſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Ieſuites, nay rather true and onely Patriarches of our Church. Doubtleſſe it is not without reaſon, that you be called Fathers after the accompliſhment of your laſt vow. Well then, the caſe ſo ſtanding, if your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhould commaund you to procure the death, I will not ſay of a Prince, (for I doubt not but you would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him therin) but of our holy Father the Pope, would you doe it? <hi>Ieſ.</hi> I would take time to deliberate. <hi>Gent.</hi> If you ſhould do ſo, this were not to tie your conſcience any longer vnto his ſleeue. <hi>Ieſ.</hi> You take me vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I craue reſpite to make you an aunſwere. <hi>Gent.</hi> Your Order beeing grounded vpon all theſe godly and holy reſolutions, ſurely our Church is much bounde to you, I meane, not the auncient Doctors of the Church onely, but the Apoſtles themſelues, whom you haue taught their dutie. Nay, what ſpeake I of the Apoſtles? you haue taught the great Maiſter of the Mould, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee ought to faſhion all our actions: when contrarie to the expreſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement giuen S. Peter, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the death of Kings and Princes. But what reward haue you got by this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſ.</hi> As much as wee can deſire or hope for. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, we are allowed to giue abſolution of all ſinnes and offences howe foule ſoeuer they be, except ſuch as are reſerued to the holy Sea, wholly extreated &amp; iſſuing out of Iudgements, Cenſures, and Eccleſiaſticall paines, beſide that which is compriſed in the Bull vſually

               <p>In the yeere of our Lord 1554. the firſt of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the moſt ſacred facultie of the Diuines in Paris, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt was celebrated in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Sorbons</hi> Chappell, according to their cuſtome, this fourth time, by oath aſſembled together, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of the two Bulles, which two holy Fathers the Popes, <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, and <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, are ſayd to haue graunted to theſe men that deſire to be honoured with the ſocietie of IESVS. Which two Bulles, the Senate or Court of Parliament of Paris, ſent by <hi>Hostia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to the ſaid Facultie to be peruſed and examined.</p>
               <p>Before they entreated of ſo high and weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all and ſinguler our Maiſters in pubique with open mouth proteſted, that they decreed, deuiſd, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing againſt the authoritie and power of the Pope, but all and euery of them, like obedient Chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as they euer acknowledged and confeſſed him to be Chriſtes chiefe &amp; vniuerſall Vicar, and generall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of the Church, whom all ſorts of both Sectes are bound to obey, to honour his decrees, and euery one to defend them to his power: So nowe alſo, they doe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, faithfully, and willingly acknowledge &amp; confeſſe the ſame. But becauſe euery man, eſpecially Diuines, ought to be readie to giue an aunſwere to euery one that asketh them of matters appertaining to fayth, manners, and edification of the Church, the ſaide Facultie hath thought it meete to ſatisfie the requeſt, commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and entreatie of the Court. Therefore all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of both Bulles beeing often read, repeated, and conceiued, &amp; for the greatnes of the matter, many daies, monthes, and houres, according to their cuſtome, firſt
<pb facs="tcp:14558:27"/>verie diligently diſcuſt, and examined, at laſt with one conſent, but with great reuerence and humilitie, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all to the controlement of the Apoſtolike ſea, they gaue this doome.</p>
               <p>This new Societie chalenging to it ſelfe the rare title of the name of Ieſus, ſo licentiouſly, and hand ouer-head, admitting all ſorts of perſons how wicked, illegitimate, or infamous ſoeuer, diffring nothing from ſecular prieſts in outward apparrell, tonſure, canonicall howers, either priuately to be ſaid, or publikely to be ſung in churches, in cloiſtures and ſilence, in choiſe of meates and daies, in faſts and other ceremonies (whereby religious orders are diſtinguiſht, and preſerued) endowed with ſo many and ſundrie priuiledges, grants, and liberties, eſpecially in adminiſtration of the Sacraments of penance, and of the Euchariſt, &amp; that without difference of place or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as alſo in the office of preaching, reading, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, to the preiudice of the Ordinaries, of the Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall order, to the preiudice likewiſe of other religious men, nay euen of Princes &amp; temporall Lords, againſt the priuiledges of the Vniuerſities, and to the great griefe of the people, appeares to defloure monaſticall religion: it cuts the ſinewes of the painfull, holy, and neceſſarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of vertues, of abſtinence, ceremonies, and auſteritie, it opens a gap to Apoſtacie from other religious orders, it takes away due obedience from the Ordinaries, it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly depriues the Lords ſpirituall &amp; temporall of their right: It breeds a garboile in both gouernments, many complaints among the people, many iarres, diſcords, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, rebellions, &amp; ſundry ſchiſmes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe and other things of like nature thorowly examined and waighed. <hi>This Societie appeares to be in matter of faith daungerous, to the peace of the Church tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, to monaſticall religion ruinous, and more apt to pull downe than to build vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was there euer a better ſentence, mixt with a truer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14558:27"/>prophecie than this? And why? There was no banding then in the field, euerie man ſlept ſafe in the ſinceritie of his conſcience towards God, there were no tumultuary aſſemblies, but for foure daies togither, &amp; by them that had determined of it long before. Much leſſe minded they to oppoſe themſelues againſt the authority of the holy Sea, as we gather from their humble prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation. For this cauſe, the holy Ghoſt after their deuout inuocation of him by their ſacrifice, ſpake thorough the organe of this ſacred facultie. And thus am I perſwaded, that for theſe thouſand yeers, there was neuer any worke of the holy Ghoſt greater, and more apparant to our eies than was this cenſure. The Court of Parliament of Paris ſent thoſe Buls onely of Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> dated the yeere 1543. And that of <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, dated the yeere 1550. The Ieſuites kept all the other cloſe, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring date of the yeeres 43.45.46.49.</p>
               <p>Vpon the ſight but of thoſe two ends of their ware they iudged wiſely what the reſt of the whole peece might be. Without any more a do, remember thoſe three lines. <hi>It breeds many complaints among the people, manie iarres, diſſentions, contentions, rebellions, and ſundrie ſchiſmes:</hi> and conferre them with your diſcouery of their order, you ſhall find the Sorbons ſpeech true. The diuine ſeruice of their Church is diuided from ours, their priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges make a deuiſion betweene the Biſhops and them, the Monaſteries and them, the Vniuerſities and them, the Diuines of Paris and them. Their propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo, make a diuiſion betweene the holy Sea and Princes. But how be theſe priuiledges maintaind? By their Colledges, their confeſſions, their preaching. Their Colledges are traps to catch youth, their confeſſions, ſubornations; their Sermons, Mounte-banks Markets. If you beleeue this Ieſuite here, he will ſay: we haue no preachers but them to defend the olde Church. It is not yet aboue threeſcore yeeres ſince they were ſet a foote.
<pb facs="tcp:14558:28"/>What preachers haue we had of them in Paris? One <hi>Aimond Auger,</hi> and <hi>Iames Commolet.</hi> I remember none but theſe. On the other ſide, how many hath the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Vniuerſitie in Paris bred, of learned and holy men, neuer tainted with innouation? Againe, did euer any man in our time heare a Ieſuite handle or expound in Pulpit or open aſſembly, any one text of Scripture, either to vphold the Apoſtolike Sea, or lay hereſie in the duſt? What is the ſumme of their preaching? To bite them that are abſent, not to edifie them that are preſent, except it be to ſcandale kings and princes. And that which is moſt admirable in this cenſure, is, that our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines ſaw the rebellions, theſe new maſters would raiſe vp in time to come, againſt our king. Therefore while I now embarke my ſelfe againſt them, it is neither gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, malice, nor folly, that caries me with wind and tide. I ſet the venerable facultie of the diuines of Paris before mine eies, for my Vice-admirall, to carie the light in my nauigation.</p>

After that they crouded into more ſpacious manſions, they bought the great houſe of <hi>Langre</hi> in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſtreet, where they erected a Colledge and Monaſterie both together vnder diuers roofes, they did read publike lectures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the rector of the Vniuerſities allowance, they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred the holy Sacraments of penance, and of the altar to all commers and goers, without leaue of the Odina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The Caluiniſts began to preach and teach, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together openly, yet not ſo couertly as they did before. Witneſſe the great aſſembly, ſurpriſed by the Court of Parliament before Pleſſies Colledge, where an infinite number of men and women were taken, and after that an Aduocate, a Scholemaiſter, and a Damſell put to death. Thus may I ſay, and ſay truly, theſe two ſects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſet vp their reſts within Paris in S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſtreet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out to fifteen or twentie houſes one after another. And after this vowed, the one to haue <hi>Ieſus</hi> name ſtampt vpon their piſtolet crownes, the Ieſuits to haue it ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the gates of their Colledges with a croſſe aloft, to ſhew that they did lodge at the ſigne of the croſſe. As the Caluiniſts cald their religion, the reformed religion, ſo the Ieſuits gloried, that in ſome part of Italy, namely in <hi>Modena,</hi> they were cald the reformed alſo. And as the Caluiniſts whom we terme Hugonots roſe vp in armes in Fraunce, in the yeere, 1561. So the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits tooke example by them, and had recourſe vnto armes about the yeere 1585. to enclarge their bounds.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14558:29"/>
               <p>If I be not deceiued in the time, nor miſſe my marke, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond died: wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Caluiniſts thought they might make their way faire without noiſe, through the midſt of Fraunce. This good king left behind him foure young princes his children vnder the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers charge, a ſtranger princeſſe, not allied to the great houſes of France, thereby was ſhe vnfit to ſecond them in gouernment of the ſtate, and education of theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Thus at one inſtant the two ſects began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: one by the Kings death, the other by a Biſhops deceaſe. During the minority of our Kings, the Nobility of France couered their ambition with a cloake of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. New partialities grew among them, ſome taking part with the old religion, others with the new: euerie one of them (by the iudgement of the wiſeſt) ſeeking his owne gaine &amp; aduancement, more then deuotion. In this encounter, the miniſters of whoſe companie ſome were burnt before, put vp a ſupplication to <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, to giue them audience. This was ſoone granted, &amp; the town of Poiſſy appointed for this purpoſe, where many Cardinals, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Doctors of Diuinitie were aſſembled on the one ſide: and many Miniſters, of whom <hi>Thodor Beza</hi> was the ring-leader, ſeconded by <hi>Peter Marter, Marlorat, Cimpoll,</hi> and ſome of good place and marke among them, on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>Vpon the ſentence of the Sorbons giuen in the yeere 1554. the Ieſuits finding their hope to be forlorne, ſought to Ma. <hi>Noel Brullarte</hi> the Kings Procurator ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, in the court of Parliament of Paris, the ſeuereſt man in his place, that euer was ſeen. Theſe men that ſlip no opportunitie to aduance themſelues, hearing of the great conference at Poiſſy, promiſed to put in their foot among them. At that time one <hi>Ponce Congordan</hi> was their Agent in Paris, of whom <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinall of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine was wont to ſay, he was the cunningeſt negotiation
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14558:29"/>that euer he knew though he had knowne many. He then it was that tooke the matter in hand, preſented his requeſt to the Court of Parliament of Paris, not in the name of the Societie of Ieſus, but in the name of the Colledge of Clairmount, whereby the Ieſuits proteſted to abiure their vowes, entreating the Court to allow of their Colledge. Which if the Court had done, it had beene a meane to allow their legacie giuen them. The Court according to their prudence and pietie, ſent this requeſt to the French Church then aſſembled at Poiſſy, to determine of it. Neuer was there a fairer aſſembly, and neuer did aſſembly bring forth more miſchiefe to the ſtate then that. I feare not to put the Placard into his hands that ſhall write the Hiſtorie of our times, for they authorized both ſects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all conſideration. And, which I moſt wonder at, the inſtruments hereof were two Cardinals, men of great knowledge and zeale, no young prentizes in the miſteries of religion, or affaires of ſtate; one of them had been emploied in the greateſt matters of this kingdome, in the time of the mightie king <hi>Francis:</hi> the other in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. The two ſpeciall were the Cardinals of Tournon and Lorraine. The firſt for the grauitie of his yeeres, and conſequently for the ſoundnes of his iudgement, was perſwaded that this conference with the miniſters was in no caſe to be admitted, for that the entring into it was a kind of acknowledging them to be a part of our common-weale, whom heretofore we took to be rotten members, howſoeuer the nonage of the king might diſpence with their opinions vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this point. The ſecond, in the flower of his yeeres, vpon the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had in his owne wit, ſeconded by two great diuines <hi>Diſpence</hi> &amp; <hi>Salignac,</hi> deſired to bring the matter vpon the ſtage, flattering himſelfe, that if they might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vpon <hi>Beza,</hi> the matter might eaſily be drawne to a head.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14558:30"/>
               <p>The moſt voyces went with him. The Cardinall of <hi>Tournon,</hi> ſpying himſelfe ſupplanted in his oppinion, beganne to drawe vp the Ieſuits, a faire and glorious pretence (as ſeemed) to giue battaile to the newe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Heerein was he followed by a number of other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, not becauſe they did not fore-ſee what an infinite number of inconueniences might ariſe out of it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought poyſons muſt be purged by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyſons. The Scaffolds built, the Cardinall of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> played theyr prizes before the young King, in the preſence of many States diuerſly affected. The aſſembly broken vp, after this wee had three Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions openly in Fraunce. The one, ſounded nothing but the word of GOD in their preachings: The next, tooke vp the Name of Ieſus in their Sinagogues: The third, was our auncient Catholiques, to whom we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in our Churches, the honour of our fayth by the onely Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſoris</hi> for theyr Aduocate, the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie entertaind <hi>Paſquier.</hi> The cauſe pleaded by theſe two, here was the ſport, <hi>Paſquier</hi> at the firſt puſh, ſhewed them, that to read theyr requeſt onely, was enough to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow them. For the foundation of theyr cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended vppon the French Churches decree, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them expreſly to take vppon them the name of the ſocietie of Ieſus, which title notwithſtanding they had inſerted into theyr requeſt. This was to ſtrike the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> right vpon the viſor, by meanes whereof, they were compeld to flie to a deniall, where they tooke ſanctuary for the liberty of their actions, as often as they found themſelues driuen into any narrowe ſtreight that might preiudice them. <hi>Verſoris</hi> denied him that framed the requeſt, that was in plaine termes <hi>Congordan,</hi> who denied himſelfe, by the mouth of his owne Aduocate whom hee choſe. By the negotiations which haue on their part paſſed between them and vs, to ſet vp their
<pb facs="tcp:14558:32"/>ſect, An Aſſe and a Foxe haue beene tyed together.</p>
               <p>A meruallous matter, and worthy to be rung into the eares of all ſucceeding ages. Firſt, they of the newe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, troubled vs about the towne of Amboiſe, againſt the Lords protectors of the young King, <hi>Fraunces</hi> the ſecond, partly by the conference had at Poiſſy, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuian preaching inſinuated into Fraunce. Laſtly, by the ſurprize of townes, and a bloody battaile fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dreux. In briefe, by a ciuill warre of 18. monethes continuaunce, vpon the parcialities of Papiſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, which was afterward luld a ſleepe with an Edict of conniuence, our hands beeing yet embrued with the blood of thoſe troubles, and hauing ſcarce any leyſure to take our breath. In this progreſſe by degrees, the Ieſuits requeſt was preſented to the Court of Parliament, that had tenne Aduocates, (as <hi>Montaignes</hi> and <hi>Fon</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in their writinges) in reſpect of 13. aduerſaries,<note place="margin">Mont. ca. 22 Fon. ca. 4.</note> which <hi>Fon</hi> reports, were ſixe boyſterous &amp; mightie lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med bodies, to wit, the Vniuerſities, the Sorbons, the Mendicants, the Hoſpitals, and the Pariſh prieſts. With other foure Lordes of great authoritie, namely the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Paris, the Cardinall Chaſtilion, as protector of the Vniuerſitie, the Biſhop of Paris, and the Abbot of S. Geniueue.</p>
               <p>Now, can we be ſo ſenceleſſe, as to thinke that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, both of the better and meaner ſort, banded againſt them without cauſe, in a matter of ſo great importance? But what were the commons? thoſe which of late me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie plagued the Hugonots, out of all meaſure, raced the walls of Patriarch and Popincourt, where they had theyr exerciſe of religion: who by order of Lawe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curd the death of <hi>Gabaston,</hi> the Captaine of their garde, and protector of theyr attempts, together with <hi>Cagres,</hi> both the Father and the ſonne. So many Sages of the common people (ſworne enemies to hereſie) did ſette the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt the Ieſuits, lying but yet in the ſuburbs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14558:32"/>of our ciuill warres; againſt the Ieſuits I ſay, who then vaunted themſelues to be the ſcourge of Hereticks. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly it cannot be, but that all thoſe great perſonages, who then vndertooke the quarrell againſt them, were perſwaded that this Sect was extreamely to be feared, as well by the libertie of the French Church and generall eſtate of Fraunce, as of all Chriſtendome. Beſides theſe two great parties, there was yet another, more ſtrong &amp; mightie then them both, namely, Mounſieur <hi>Meſnil</hi> the Kings Aduocate in the Court of parliament, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to them.</p>
               <p>But for all this great multitude of partakers (ſayth the Ieſuite) the matter came not to open triall, but was put ouer to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, as a plaine argument that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our cauſe did craue very much fauour. Poore foole, and young Scholler, hadſt thou been brought vp in the light of the Royall pallace, or read the courſe of iuſtice of our kings, as thou art nuzled in the duſt of the Colledges, thou ſhouldſt haue knowne that the high Courts admit no open triall of great cauſes, they haue no time nor leyſure, duly to informe theyr conſciences. As appeares by a like courſe helde by the ſame Court in the month of Iuly, 94. And for this cauſe, Mounſieur <hi>Marion</hi> pleading againſt the Ieſuits of Lyons, in the yeere 97. ſaid, that a defectiue and imperfect prudence of the yeere 64. was in ſome ſort the occaſion that the affaires of Fraunce degenerated with the time, &amp; waxed worſe and worſe. As for my ſelfe, I will ſay more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with open face. that this matter was in the yeere 64. put ouer to counſell by the wiſedome of men, but thys counſaile was guided by the hand of God, who to take vengeance of our ſinnes, preſerued the Ieſuits as a deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inſtrument hung aſide in the Temple, fit for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſeries of Fraunce.</p>
               <p>To what purpoſe is all this, ſaue onely this, to ſhewe you that if I deteſt &amp; abhorre the Sect of Ieſuits, I haue
<pb facs="tcp:14558:33"/>no ſmall ſhelters for my oppinion: firſt the venerable cenſure of Paris, the yere 1554. wherein were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Diuines that euer were in Fraunce, and by name, <hi>Picard, Maillard, Demochares, Perionius, Ory,</hi> the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiter for matters of faith. The firſt, an admirable prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, whoſe body after his death being layd forth in his houſe in the Deanry of S. Germins of Lauxerrois, the people of Paris for the ſanctimony of his life, did ſtriue to kiſſe his feete: the foure other his companions, were extreame perſecutors of the Heretiks. I haue the great decree of the French church, in the yeere 61. the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that did ſecond it, and finally, many men of marke and communalty, ſet againſt them in the yeere 1564. Amongſt theſe, I may ſpeake it for a certainty, which I ought to beleeue becauſe I ſaw it. There was two hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reſemblances of antiquitie, Solicitors in the cauſe, <hi>Bennet</hi> the Deane, and <hi>Courſelles</hi> the Subdeane of the facultie of the Diuinitie Schooles in Paris; The one, fourſcore yeeres of age, the other, threeſcore &amp; ſeauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene: both ready to depart from hence, to giue vp an account of theyr actions in another world, at which time euery man ſtandes ſtricte vppon his conſcience. With them was <hi>Faber Sindic,</hi> one of the wiſeſt men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was among the Sorbons.</p>
               <p>In the winding vp of all, I will ſet downe Ma. <hi>Noell Brullarte,</hi> Procurator generall, the great <hi>Aristides</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> of his time, which liuing in the yeere 50. withſtood the receiuing of the Ieſuites. I tell you this, expreſly to diſcouer how like the iugling of the Ieſuits of our time, is to the former. For <hi>Fon</hi> is ſo impudent as to report, that <hi>Ramus</hi> &amp; <hi>Mercerus,</hi> after they became the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, reuolted from our auncient Religion, and were folicitors in this cauſe, and that if they had not encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred them, they had won the field: but to auoid ſedition, the Court was forced, warilie to ſtrike ſaile to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, by putting the matter off to counſell.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:14558:33"/>
               <p>Well, but yet thou lyeſt moſt impudently thou Ieſuit. (Pardon me, for it is very fit I ſhould be in choller.) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ramus</hi> nor <hi>Mercerus,</hi> for theyr parts euer ſtirred in this, although they tooke part with their brethren, the Kings Profeſſors, becauſe they would not ſeparate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the body of the Vniuerſitie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, what likelihood is there, that the mindes generally of the Pariſiens could be ſo ſuddenly changed to take part with the Hugonots. <hi>Mercerus</hi> was ſo farre from faction, that hee had no skill in any thing but He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue, wherein he ſpent all his time without intermiſſion: and became ſo great a Superlatiue in that tongue, that by the iudgement of the beſt learned, he was preferd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Iewes. In all worldly matters hee ſtoode but for a bare Cypher. But this is a Ieſuiticall priuiledge, to vnderſet theyr ſlaunders with the time by newe cogges. For if this Ieſuit <hi>Fon</hi> durſt, he would ſay that the towne, the Vniuerſitie, and the facultie of Diuinitie in Paris, all the foure orders of Mendicants, &amp; the Pariſh prieſts, were Hugonots, becauſe they hindred the matriculation of this holy Order: what other conſequence can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from his ſpeech? Oh ſinguler and admirable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie, yet to be excuſed, becauſe it proceedeth from a Ieſuit. Neuertheleſſe, to ſhew with what truth &amp; inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity I mean to confound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their lying, they cauſed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſoris</hi> Plea to be printed in the yere 94. &amp; he to bring the Vniuerſity into hatred,<note place="margin">In the 24. &amp; 32. leafe of Verſoris Plea.</note> ſaith firſt &amp; formoſt, not that <hi>Mercerus</hi> but <hi>Ramus</hi> &amp; <hi>Gallandius</hi> were made ſolicitors in this cauſe: but this was ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all likelihood of truth, that euery man tooke it for an hyperbole, by reaſon of the open enmity they caried to all times, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them vnto their death. This enmity, <hi>Rablays</hi> the <hi>Lucian</hi> of our age, in the preface of his 3. booke, &amp; after him <hi>Ioachim Bellay,</hi> a gallant Poet, in one of his chiefe Poems, ſcoffed at, with expreſſe inuentions, which are the beſt paſſages in all theyr bookes.

At their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his new companions arriuing there, plotted (in the yeere 1539) to eſtabliſh a new ſect that ſhould make the three ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie vowes of other religious, &amp; a fourth beyond them all, concerning miſſion: and that they ſhould haue a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, whom they ſhould be bound abſolutely to obey, without any reaſon yeelded them.

                  <hi>to his word they muſt ſweare, and eſteeme his becke and his will as an Oracle of God.</hi> And after, they concluded that their Generall ſhould continue in this dignitie while he liued. <hi>Moreouer, that whoſoeuer entred this profeſſion, ſhould to the three ſolemne vowes of all other religious houſes, adde a fourth, to go without ſhrinking to whatſoeuer countrey of beleeuers, or iufidels, it ſhould pleaſe the Pope to ſend them, and that without fee, or ſo much as petition to defray their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by the way.</hi> Thus you ſee in the firſt planting of them, another abſolute obedience to their General, in all things
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14558:34"/>different from that to the Pope, concerning their miſſion onely. I will leaue the reſt of their rule preſented to <hi>Paul</hi> the third, to the examination it pleaſed his holineſſe to make of it. He committed it to three Cardinals to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe, which thought good to refuſe it, ſpecially the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Guidicion. Ignatius</hi> whom I haue allowed for one of the moſt ſharpe and worldly wiſe men our age affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, knew he had plaid the Clarke, and in his new ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute couched a greater obedience to the Generall, than to the holy Sea. For this cauſe he reformed his rule, and made their obedience to the Pope and their Generall in both alike.

From this paſſage you may gather, that aſſoone as they offered him abſolute obedience in all things, Pope <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> began to lend a fauourable eare vnto them. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he ſtood a while in doubt to open any broad way freely for them to enter, for in the yeere 1540. he alowed them no number aboue threeſcore, afterwards in the yeere 43. he laid the gate wide open vnto them.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr whole country of Fraunce was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much offended at the proud and partiall name of Ieſuites, which they tooke vpon them. The French Church firſt, next to it the Court of Parliament, expreſly forbad the vſe of it. <hi>Meſnil</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:35"/>the kings great Aduocate pleaded the cauſe, ſhewing how odious the name ought to be among Chriſtians: for ripping vp the reaſons that moued the Biſhop, the facultie of Diuinitie, and the Vniuerſitie of Paris to reiect them at their firſt arriuall; The maine reaſons were (quoth he) firſt the inſolent name &amp; title of Ieſuits, and verily by how much the more the name may be tollerated among Iewes, Turks, and Pagans, by ſo much the more it is to be refuſed among Chriſtians, which do all make profeſſion of the law of Ieſus. It is as worthie to be blamed, as if a man ſhould attribute and vſurpe vnto himſelfe alone the name of a Chriſtian, among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the name of a French man among the French, or the name of Pariſian among the Pariſians. Moreouer the name of Ieſus is of ſuch dignitie and excellencie, that his Diſciples &amp; Followers left it only to their Head, and neuer tooke but the adiectiue of Chriſtian, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are contented to this day. Vpon the ſame ground <hi>Paſquier</hi> ſaid as much in a Plea of his. I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with their name, and after deſcend to their propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Firſt of all, they call themſelues Ieſuits in the midſt of Chriſtians. Bleſſed God, is not this an accuſation of the Apoſtles? happie and renowmed were thoſe holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſeeing our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt face to face, to heare his exhortations daly, and after his aſcenſion into heauen, to receiue the holy Ghoſt from him. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, knowing with what humility they ought to regard and honour that great and holy name of Ieſus, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer durſt call themſelues Ieſuits, but Chriſtians onely, in the towne of Antioch, where that name was taken vp by them: and as for matters of religion they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo handled, that as in Rome, the Popes neuer took vpon them the name of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> for the honour &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence they bare to their Captain: ſo in Chriſtendome was there neuer any Chriſtian baptized by the name of Ieſus. All the old fathers knew it well, that it had beene
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14558:35"/>blaſphemie to attribute the name due to the onely Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Sauiour of mankind, vnto a meere creature. You muſt acknowledge then (my maiſters <hi>Ignatiens</hi>) that you blaſpheme againſt the honour of God, when you intitle your ſelues Ieſuits. It may be you will ſay we do not take vpon vs the name of Ieſus, but of Ieſuits, to let the people know that we be Ieſus followers. Why? did the Apoſtles &amp; other diſciples of our Lord, &amp; they that immediatly ſucceeded him, briefly all the old fathers of the Primitiue Church, trace any leſſe after him then you do? ſo as by ſome ſpeciall priuiledge you muſt borrow this title and not they? Furthermore I would be glad to learne whether we, by withdrawing our ſelues from the vow of your arrogant ſuperſtition, be ſhut out from the fellowſhip of our Lord and Maiſter Ieſus Chriſt? <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier</hi> ſaid well, that it is to call the Apoſtles in queſtion. For <hi>Fon</hi> the Ieſuit defended afterwards, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans title, was a prouder ſtile then the Ieſuits. <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his companie (as they ſaid) being deſirous to draw our Church backe to the ſteps of the Apoſtles times, plotted to miniſter the Sacraments of pennance &amp; of the Altar, and to preach Cods word. And by this deuice they ſpred farre without the authoritie of the holy Sea, and they likewiſe deſired to be intitled, the company of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. The Apoſtles miniſtred theſe two Sacraments, and caried the Goſpell ouer all the world, was it then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to theſe new vndertakers to do the like? I denie it? For they ſucceeded not the Apoſtles, but the Biſhops, and vnder them the Curates. The Ieſuits deuotion was built vpon ignorance, by reaſon wherof, they ought not to be called Ieſus followers, but his forſakers, as bringers in of a new ſchiſme into the Church. Yet haue they by this erronious propoſition, qualified themſelues with the title of Ieſus company. A ſtile neuer giuen them by our holy father, but arrogated to themſelues, as manifeſtly appeares in a paſſage of their requeſt preferd to <hi>Paulus</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:36"/>the third, and interlaced in the Bull in the yeere 1540. <hi>Whoſoeuer in our Society (which we deſire to be oderned with the name of Ieſus) is willing to warre vnder the banner of the croſſe.</hi> This clauſe is repeated word for word, as it lieth in the Bull of <hi>Iulius</hi> the third in the yeere 1550. which is the confirmation of their priuiledges. It were abſurd to thinke Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> would honour them with ſo proud a title, who refuſed them at the firſt, &amp; after ward allotted them but a certaine number, &amp; that with many ſcruples of conſcience. Neuertheleſſe, as the Ieſuits neuer lackt new lying inuentions to credit them, ſo they bruted it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that they held this title by the faith and homage of the holy Sea. Indeed the firſt Chapter of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions begins in this manner. <hi>This little congregation, which by their firſt inſtitution was called the Societie of Ieſus, by the Sea Apoſtolike.</hi> And agreeable vnto this, <hi>

I blame not the Aduocate, a man of account: for he pleaded vpon the aduertiſements gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, but I excuſe not theſe wiſe men the Ieſuits, which are made lyers by their owne Buls. There is no lye ſo impudent as that, but the authoritie of the holy Sea was not ſufficient to grace them by this forgerie: they muſt haue recourſe to miracles, that is to ſay, to their iugling caſts.<note place="margin">Maff. lib. 2. ca. 5. Rabad lib. 1. ca. 12.</note> Of late yeeres <hi>Maffee</hi> firſt, and then <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badener</hi> found out, that <hi>Ignace</hi> accompanied with <hi>Peter Faure,</hi> and <hi>Iames Lainez,</hi> going through a Church, not farre from Rome, being at his praiers, fell into a trance, wherein God the Father appeared to him, who comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Ignace</hi> &amp; his companions to Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, then loaded with his croſſe, &amp; marked with his wounds, which promiſed to take him into his protection, &amp; ſaid to <hi>Ignace</hi> at that inſtant, I wil aſſiſt thee in Rome. And as ſoone as <hi>Ignace</hi> went out of the Church, he diſcouered
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14558:36"/>to his two companions what viſion he had. That this is but a tale of a tubbe, I haue no doubt at all. <hi>Iames Lainez</hi> ſucceeded him in the Generalſhip, who being priuie to this miracle, how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to paſſe he neuer ſignified ſo much to <hi>Congordan</hi> his Agent, &amp; <hi>Verſoris</hi> his Aduocate, when the cauſe was pleaded? Why did he ſmother this great miracle when it was requiſite to diſcloſe it? For that which was chiefly obiected againſt them in the aſſembly of Poiſſie, and afterward in the court of Parliament of Paris, was the inſolencie of this proud title of the Society of Ieſus. Why (I ſay) did not <hi>Lainez</hi> &amp; his crue, giue vs notice of this matter, when the French Church and the court of Parliament forbad them this title. They did not ſo much then, becauſe neither the diuell, nor his impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, built their neſts in their pens, as they did at laſt. Neuertheles, this lye profited them no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another which we ſee with our eies. For when <hi>Maffee</hi> had told vs this tale, marke what he puts to it. <hi>And this was the chiefeſt cauſe, for which after the Society was confirmed, he gaue it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the name of Ieſus.</hi> If that be true which this lyer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, it followes, that <hi>Ignace</hi> &amp; his companions, tooke not the title of Ieſus Society, but after their order was cofirmed, yet by their requeſts put vp to Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into their firſt Bull of the yeere 1540. they attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this name vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that which greatly waighes it, is, that foure or fiue yeeres after, <hi>Montaignes</hi> a Ieſuit roundly confeſſing that to be falſe which <hi>Maffee</hi> &amp; <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badener</hi> haue written,<note place="margin">Cap. 66. of Truth defended.</note> he fathers this inuention vpon the Pope. <hi>I anſwere you</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Arnault</hi>) <hi>that it is the Pope which gaue the name to this holy company, &amp; the ſacred cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that allowed them, which ſuffices to ſtop your mouth.</hi> The verie ſame ſaith <hi>Fon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fon. ca. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>The people gaue them the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, becauſe the holy Sea called them the company of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> And two leaues after, <hi>The Ieſuits tearmed not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Iuſuits, but the holy Sea termed them the companie of Ieſus.</hi> I commend the conſcience of theſe two honeſt
<pb facs="tcp:14558:37"/>Ieſuits, who ſpeaking nothing of <hi>Ignaces</hi> viſion mocke themſelues in their ſoules with theſe two flatteries. But I cannot chuſe but excuſe their ignorance, for had they red their firſt Bull of <hi>Paul</hi> the third, they ſhould haue found that <hi>Ignace</hi> &amp; his companions were intitled the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Ieſus when they preferd their petition to the Pope.</p>
               <p>The Aduocate ſtanding vpon theſe contrarieties, one of the company ſaid to him: Me thinks you labour in vaine. They haue this name of Ieſuits, neither from God nor from the Pope: but only from the common people, which is a great Philoſopher and controuler of our actions. You ſee <hi>Fon</hi> agrees vnto it: but you muſt vnderſtand at large, how matters paſſe on this ſide. Being at the firſt named the companie or Societie of Ieſus, the people marking their behauiour called them <hi>Ieſuiſts,</hi> not Ieſuits, pronouncing S. and T. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For when their cauſe was pleaded in the yeere 64. The Aduocates cald them nothing elſe but <hi>Ieſuiſts.</hi> See the counſell Maiſter <hi>Charles Moulin,</hi> one of the beſt lawyers in Fraunce gaue vpon the receiuing them. The title was this, <hi>Whether the Ieſuits be to be receiued in the Realme of Fraunce, and admitted in the Vniuerſitie of Paris.</hi> And all along his diſcourſe ſpeaking of them, he vſeth no other terme than <hi>Ieſuiſts.</hi> A matter which you ſhal find auouched alſo in <hi>Verſoris</hi> Plea,<note place="margin">Fol. 30. Verſoris Plea.</note> put forth in print by them. <hi>Men qualified their title</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and called them the Colledge of Ieſuiſts.</hi> And ſo it continued a little after. But they could not leaue it, for ſo much as they ought to haue a common name fitting the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Colledges belonging to them. Which can not bee that of Clairmounte, except peraduenture for the three Colledges ſake founded by the Biſhop of Clairmounte: It is therefore requiſite they ſhould adde the word <hi>Ieſuiſts.</hi> This verie name was afterward in vſe in their owne Colledge at Paris, when they were expeld.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:14558:37"/>
               <p>It is true, that in proceſſe of time the common people for the eaſier pronunciation, diſcarded the S. and called them Ieſuits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſteed of <hi>Ieſuiſts.</hi> And when <hi>Paſquier</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Epiſtles in the yeere 1586. likewiſe when the Plea was printed in the yeere 94. And that of the Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>Meſnil,</hi> they were termed <hi>Ieſuiſts</hi> according to the common cuſtome of time. Neither was this refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſoris</hi> Plea. Take it then for certaine, that they were called <hi>Ieſuiſts,</hi> as you may better be informed by ſuch as liued in thoſe daies, &amp; this was done vpon graue conſideration, for no ſparke of true Ieſus being in them, but hypocriſie only appareld with his name, the people branded them with the name of <hi>Ieſuiſts.</hi> In like manner you know that from the Greeke word <hi>Sophos,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſage, in old time the word Sophiſter was deriued, to decipher ſuch a one as troubled the waters of Wiſdom. Therfore we do noate by the name of <hi>Ieſuiſts</hi> theſe new diſturbers of Ieſus &amp; his Church. After this manner in our time, from the word <hi>Deus,</hi> ſome haue wreſted a title of men deified, which is a new hereſie. And as God ſhines in his wiſdome, ſo ſhal it not be from the purpoſe to couple a Ieſuiſt &amp; a Sophiſter togither, becauſe a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſt is nothing elſe but the Sophiſter of our Catholique religion.</p>
               <p>Here ſaid the Aduocate, you haue reaſon, &amp; not only I ſubſcribe to your obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but more, I hold him a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie beaſt, which ſhal not acknowledge them to be of the Societie of Ieſus. Verely they are, but iuſt as <hi>Iudas</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Apoſtles, ſo many Ieſuies ſo many Iudaſes, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to betray their princes or their countries, whenſoeuer occaſion ſerues to do it. What wil you giue vs (wil be the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſong to thoſe princes that haue moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) &amp; we will deliuer our Leege Lord into your hands, or troble his ſtate that it may be yeelded to you. Did they not attempt the ſame in Fraunce, and if our famous <hi>Henry</hi> had beleeued them, had they not performed it?

                  <note place="margin">Turcel lib. 1 ca. 10. of Xauers life.</note>) <hi>the excellencie of theyr vertue, and contempt of the worlde, was miraculous in the eyes of the whole Cittie. It was bruted among the commen people, that twelue Priests, (for two were added to the ten) had combined together at Rome. Two of the which company liuing among them, ſeemed to carrie (I know not what) ſhew of an Apostolicall life. This made the people, whether it were for the equalitie of the number, or for the conformit is of life, to begin by too great a title, to call them Apostles, and continued ſo to tearme them though much against theyr wills. For the Portugalls, beeing no leſſe constant in theyr dooings, then religious in determination, they coulde neuer be drawne to recall that name which they had once giuen (as they thought) vnto the truth. Nay the matter proceeded ſo farre, that this name grew to be impoſd vppon the rest of that ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, almost throughout all Portugall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truſt me, this paſſage is of ſuch deſert, that I ſhould deceiue theſe good men, if I ſhould not tranſlate it into French, to diſcouer with howe great pietie they haue purchaſt this title. For <hi>Fraunces Xauier</hi> is honoured for a great Saint among all the Ieſuits. Was there euer any impietie or impoſture greater then this, that theſe two hypocrits to be counted Apoſtles, bruted it abroad, that two new ſupplies were added to their Sect, to make vp the number of twelue Apoſtles; and that vpon this falſe alarum they were called Apoſtles. This was againſt theyr will (ſaith <hi>Turcelline</hi>) belieue the reporter. For <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier</hi> tooke ſpeciall care not to looſe his tytle when hee came into the Indies.<note place="margin">Tincel. 2. booke of Xauiers life, cap. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore, as before in Portugall, ſo in India, he began to be commonly calld an Apostle, and the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14558:39"/>ſame title afterwards, flowed from Francis as from the Head to the reſt of his fellowes.</hi> Tell me (I beſeech you) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not to renue the hereſie of <hi>Manes,</hi> whoſe followers were cald <hi>Manichees,</hi> he naming himſelfe the <hi>Paraclet,</hi> had twelue Diſciples whom he cald Apoſtles, and for ſuch he ſent them abroad one by one, to other prouinces, to ſpread abroad the poyſon of his hereſie through their preaching. To ſay the truth, <hi>Ignace</hi> neuer tooke on him the name of <hi>Paraclet,</hi> yet was he willing inough to be accounted for another Ieſus by his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: As I wil diſcourſe to you in his proper place, when I come to ſpeak of their blind obedience. He did not only take this authority &amp; power vpon himſelfe. But reſigned it ouer alſo to all the Generals of his order that ſucceeded him, who in like manner haue embraced the title of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, wherewith their inferiours were endowed in Portugall.</p>
               <p>This is apparant in Rome, and yet no man ſees it, but quite contrarie, this Family is there had in honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable regard, vpon a wrong conceit men haue entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned touching their abſolute obedience, whereof theſe my Maiſters make ſemblance vnto the Pope. And ſhall we hereafter haue any maruaile to heare a barking at the holy Sea by diuerſities of new opinions that fight againſt it? Pardon me I beſeech thee, O holy Sea, for it is the heat of my zeale deuoted to thee, that inforceth me to vtter this ſpeech. Great and vnſpeakable are Gods iudgements, to ſuffer that in the Citie of Rome in your ſight and knowledge, there ſhould bee a <hi>Manes,</hi> continued by ſucceſſions from one to another, which hath not twelue onely, but infinite Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed here and there: God will reuenge it early or late, though it be by his enemies.</p>
               <p>The Aduocate as a man much wounded in heart, was deſirous to proſecute this in a chafe, when the Ieſuit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, ſaid, Verie well ſir, you are in daunger
<pb facs="tcp:14558:40"/>to be drawen drie. Marking your diſcourſe you put me in mind of thoſe young Hiſtoriographers which impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it for folly to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, that he would haue all men thinke him to be <hi>Iupiters</hi> ſonne, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed this to his immoderate ouer-weening, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it was an excellent wiſe drift of his. Can you imagine why? ſo long as the country of king <hi>Darius,</hi> was the marke he ſhot at, he was too wiſe to take that title vpon him, and choſe rather to thruſt forward his fortune by ordinarie meanes of armes. But as ſoone as he plotted to paſſe into India, a kind of new world deuided from ours, he would haue the people perſwaded by the great Prieſt of Aegypt that he was <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters</hi> ſonne, and from that time he would be adored as ſuch a one, not by the Macedonians his natural ſubiects, bred in the liberty of a Greeke ſpirit: But by the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, with ſuch reſpect and beliefe, that from that time forward they ſhould take him not to be a meere Prince, but a great God that came to the conqueſt of the Indies: this deuice tooke ſo good effect, that he made himſelfe Lord of the country without ſtriking ſtroke. The Kings, Potentates, and common people, ſaying, that their countrey was firſt vanquiſhed by <hi>Bacchus,</hi> then by <hi>Hercules,</hi> both ſonnes of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and that the whole rule and Dominion was reſerued for the comming of <hi>Alexander,</hi> a third ſonne of his. Thinke you our Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie followes not this plot? you ſee we neuer tooke the name of Apoſtles any where but in Portugall: but when we were to go to the ſame Indies where <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had beene, we thought as he did, that it was fit we ſhould be authorized beyond others, by a more ample, ſacred, and maieſticall title, which was to be called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. It had beene ill for vs to challenge it in Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, if <hi>Xauier</hi> had not continued it, by an entercourſe of his companie, after his arriuall in the Indies, to the end he might be reputed another Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſent thither
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14558:40"/>after the paſſion of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And it were impoſſible to recount what conqueſts of ſoules we made there, vnder this holy perſwaſion. Ha, (quoth the Aduocate) verily if this be your faſhion, I haue nothing to do with you: for as when you entred Italy you bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed I know not what of their Mountebanks, ſo would you do the like of <hi>Machiauell,</hi> in Portugall and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Meane while, you my maiſters that haue bragged much of your knowledge in Diuinitie, haue verie ill turnd ouer the hiſtory of the kings in the the Bible, from whence you gather by a continued ranke, that God tooke away the crownes of all the Kings of Iſrael as oft as they became Idolaters, eyther while they liued, or in all time to come neuer ſuffered them to deſcend vnto their children. How thinke you (I pray ye) that God hath left the true Kings of Portugall without heires, and that their Realme came into the hands of the firſt Prince that caught it? That one <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> a baſtard, one <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine de Medices,</hi> Queene-mother of our King, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded title to it, and laſt of all, that one <hi>Philip</hi> King of Spaine became maiſter of it without any great reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. I will not diſcourſe in partriculer of the goodnes of his title: for mine one part, I thinke that the beſt title he had, was the iuſtice of God, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſed, in reuenge of the giddie Idolatrie and blaſphemie of the kings and people, to make this realme, without triall of the cauſe, paſſe from one family to another, by this holy title of Apoſtles attributed to theſe hypocrites. And I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelfe, that the King of Spayne now raigning, will one day fall into the like miſchiefe, if he ſuffer this impietie.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 10.</hi> ¶ The impieties of William Poſtell a Ieſuits.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt why ſhould we thinke this blaphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſtrange in them, if within few yeeres after they tooke the title of Apoſtles on them, ſome one of them was found ſo abhominable in the ſight of God and man, that he cald the power of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt in queſtion, vpon the point of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. The man I ſpeake of, is <hi>William Poſtell,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Paſquier</hi> declaimed in his Plea on this manner.</p>
               <p>For ſo much as they buz nothing in the cares of ſimple women but their pietie, which they faſten to their Robes with a claſpe and a poynt, marke whether they they be ſuch indeed as they proteſt in words. We haue the Benedictines, Barnardines, Dominicans, Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, and other like orders. At the beginning of theſe profeſſions, the authors therof were found to be men of ſo holy life, that by common conſent of the Church they were regiſtred in the Kalender of Saints: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon many drawen by their good life deſired to trace after them. Peraduenture we ſhall likewiſe find, that the firſt of the Ieſuits ſect were men of ſo holy and auſtere life, that we ought to be ſo farre of from any diſlike of them, as on the contrary, we ſhould rather wiſh to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into them. About ten or twelue yeeres ago one of your old Factors came to this towne, a man as farre exceeding you in knowledge, as you do the ſimple handy-crafts man. This was Maiſter <hi>William Poſtell:</hi> we heard him preach, read, and write. He had a large Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack, reaching down to the middle leg, a long Robe, girt about him, an Epiſcopal bonnet; accompanied with a pale &amp; withered face, which bewraied nothing but great auſteritie: and he ſaid Maſſe with manie nice ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14558:41"/>not common in the Church. All this while what did he bring forth? One mother <hi>Iane,</hi> an impietie, an hereſie, the moſt deteſtable that euer was heard of ſince the incarnation of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. The Donatiſts, the Arians, the Pelagians, neuer did ſuch a thing. VVhere preached hee? Not in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie or deſert places, where men are wont to plant new religions: it was in the fayre hart of Fraunce, in the Cittie of Paris. Of what Order was hee? Of thys venerable Societie of Ieſus. Ha, beleeue mee if your ſocietie bring ſuch monſters foorth, if you ingender ſo damnable effects, God graunt wee neuer be of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie.</p>
               <p>The Ieſuits to this day deny it very ſtoutly, that <hi>Postell</hi> was euer of their ſocietie: and not onely deny it, but as ſoone as <hi>Paſquier</hi> obiected it when he pleaded the cauſe againſt them, they ſaid it was a new addition put to his olde Plea when he printed it.<note place="margin">Chap. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>Paſquier</hi> ſhewes himſelfe (ſaith the wiſard <hi>Fon</hi>) to haue loſt all the faculties of his ſoule, his vnderſtanding, his vvill, and his memorie: his vnderſtanding is full of darkenes, his will full of gale, his memory fraught with obliuion. For when the cauſe was pleaded in the yeere 64. <hi>Postell</hi> was then aliue, confined to the Monaſterie of S. <hi>Martine</hi> of the fieldes at Paris, where hee liued vntill the yeere 1580. Neuertheleſſe, this good pleader ſpeakes of him as if he had beene dead long before. And a little after: laſt of all you muſt note, that <hi>Paſquier</hi> ſpake not this when he pleaded: for he had beene checkt for ſo impudent a lie, and hiſſed at by the whole world that ſaw <hi>Postell</hi> then preſent; but this was written one and twentie yeeres after, when he defierd to publiſh it. And ſo is he contrary to himſelfe, forgetting to take that counſell the Prouerb giues, <hi>Oportet menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem eſſe memorem,</hi> to the end he may draw vp the peeces of falſhood ſo cloſe, that no body might perceiue the ſeame.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14558:42"/>
               <p>And if you will belieue me, it was not without cauſe the Ieſuits plaid this Pauin to this Perric dauncer, for if <hi>Postell</hi> were a Ieſuite, they are vndone. Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you let vs examine three things: The firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paſquier</hi> made this obiection. The ſecond, whether <hi>Postell</hi> were of their companie. And thirdly, what vvas that impietie which he ſought to bring into our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnder the name of his mother <hi>Iane?</hi> For as good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes vſe to ſay, The ſport is worthy of a candle. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt, <hi>Paſquier</hi> neuer ſpake of <hi>Postell</hi> as of a dead man: to prooue it, the beginning of the paſſage is thus. <hi>About tenne or twelue yeeres agoe, one of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie came to this Towne, a man that paſſeth you, as much as you doe the meane Artificer.</hi> By theſe words you ſee, he ſpake as of a man then liuing: but hee added afterward, <hi>This was Ma. William Postell,</hi> carrying backe all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of this diſcourſe, to the time of tenne or twelue yeeres paſt, when <hi>Postell</hi> built vp an hereſie vppon his Mother <hi>Iane,</hi> as you may gather from the ſame paſſage; which ſhewes that the Ieſuits haue neither vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, iudgement, nor memory, ſtumbling in this manner vpon <hi>Paſquier:</hi> and this is it which in the yeere 1594. they cauſed to be imprinted, in <hi>Verſoris</hi> Plea of the yeere 64. which was an anſwere to <hi>Paſquiers</hi> Plea: if you take vp the booke and reade it, in the 36. leafe you ſhal finde theſe wordes. <hi>Jt is obiected against vs, that</hi> Poſtell <hi>vvas likewiſe of our company, &amp; that by theſe bad fruites you may ſee what the tree was, I aske them, what were the fruites of Iudas, must we for them condemne our Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</hi> And a little after; <hi>Postell was neuer profeſſed in our houſe, he was a very Nouice and ſent away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would you haue a more euident demonſtration then this, to proue both that <hi>Paſquier</hi> ſpake of <hi>Postell</hi> liuing, and that he made this obiection. For otherwiſe, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſoris</hi> had fought with his owne ſhadow. Let vs nowe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether <hi>Postell</hi> were of their order. And to make it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14558:42"/>good that hee was, I apply that which I euen now read vnto you, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſoris</hi> &amp; <hi>Paſquier,</hi> were two braue Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions brought to combate in the Liſts before the chiefe Senate of Fraunce, at the foyles. The blow deliuered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Postell</hi> offended all the order, in reſpect of the place he helde among them. Had not hee beene one of them, that great Aduocate <hi>Verſoris,</hi> had neuer winded himſelfe away from this ſtroke as he did, but rather had denied it roundly, as the Ieſuits now doe, thinking that the diſtance of time hath raced it out of remembrance, but knowing that the truth then apparant, would haue complained of him, hee was not ſo hardie. By meanes whereof, ſwimming between two billowes, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him to be a Nouice of theyr Companie, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſhut out of doores.</p>
               <p>Of this expulſion you ſhall not be able to quoate any time. For after hee printed his booke of Mother <hi>Iane,</hi> that ſtunke in the noſe of all the world, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue ſuffered him to become a Nouice, as likewiſe that is verified, that a little after his booke was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Authour confined to the Monaſterie of S. <hi>Martins.</hi> As before this hee was too great a man in all kinde of learning, and of the tongues, to ſhut him out of theyr company: ſo was he ſeene publiquely apparrelled after the Ieſuits maner in Paris, in the Colledge of Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, with Father <hi>Paſquier Broet,</hi> and the other Ieſuits, in which houſe they had theyr firſt aboade. After thys, when they had a Colledge made ready for them, and gates open in the houſe of <hi>Langres</hi> in S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſtreete, he did eate and drinke with them daily: before hee was confined to the Monaſterie of S. <hi>Martine.</hi> Heereby you may ſee, that no man then doubted he was a Ieſuit.</p>
               <p>What was then his impietie grounded vppon his Mother <hi>Iane?</hi> Beeing nowe to bicker with theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended nauigators of Affrick, euery man muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that they breede as many newe Monſters as men.
<pb facs="tcp:14558:43"/>When <hi>Postell</hi> had beene many yeeres the Kings Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Greeke tongue, in the Vniuerſitie of Paris, he left his place, deſirous to hoiſt ſayle for Paleſtina, as the good <hi>Ignace</hi> did: from thence he came back to Venice, about the time of the good <hi>Ignace,</hi> where hee grew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a ſuperſticious old beldam cald Mother <hi>Iane,</hi> whom hee made his Mother. A little while after, he returned to Paris to the Colledge of Lombards, with his companions the Ieſuits, where hee printed a booke intituled, <hi>The victory of Women.</hi> In which he maintaind, that our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt redeemed the ſuperiour world onely, that is, Man; and that his Mother <hi>Iane</hi> was ſent from God to ſaue the inferiour world, that is, Women, adding <hi>Pythagoras</hi> dreames to his impietie.</p>
               <p>Hee ſought to perſwade men, that the ſoule of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> was transfuſed into her. And in another leafe, that the ſoule of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> was once in a Gold-ſmith. Shee was apparrelled like a Iewe, with a great Gaberdine of a tawny cullour; ſhee went through the Cittie bare-headed, and bare-footed, wearing a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous long hayre, crying repentance, for the end of the world was at hand. This newe S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> was afterward burnt aliue by the courſe of iuſtice, helde in the Court of Parliament of Toloſa, which would neuer take the weakenes of her wit for payment. And in ſooth, many men maruailed that <hi>Postell</hi> was not executed in like manner. For his booke was ſold publiquely by Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and it cannot any way be excuſed; except the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, (by I know not what externall infatuations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they doe inchaunt vs,) haue their ſafe conduct for euery thing. I perſwade my ſelfe, that <hi>Richeome</hi> wil one day bring in this for a great miracle in his booke of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
               <p>Wee haue to this day other remnants of <hi>Postell,</hi> for the ſame <hi>Paſquier</hi> pleading the cauſe, ſaide that <hi>Ignace</hi> was no leſſe factious &amp; troubleſome in the Church, then
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14558:43"/>
                  <hi>Martine Luther,</hi> that both the one and the other, were borne in one centenary of yeeres: <hi>Martine</hi> in the yeere, 1488. <hi>Ignace</hi> in the yeere 1491. Each of them erected his ſect, ſaying, he drew all his principles from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, that thereby they might the more eaſilie draw the ſimple people to their line, but that the <hi>Ignaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſect was more to be feared then the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through a ranke of reaſons which hee had coucht together. A ſpeciall one was, that euery one of vs would take heede of <hi>Luther,</hi> whom we iudged an Heretique: contrariwiſe, that in the behalfe of <hi>Ignace,</hi> it was an eaſie matter for men to be ouer-taken, by I knowe not what kinde of hypocriticall countenaunce vvhich they put on.</p>
               <p>This ſole concluſion (ſaith <hi>Fon</hi>) ſhewes <hi>Paſquier</hi> to be full of ignorance and malice, and if he ſpeak in good earneſt, hee is like vnto that Atheiſt whom I dare not name, that made ſuch a compariſon betweene <hi>Moſes</hi> and his law, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his ſect, &amp; called them both deceiuers. How ſo? Becauſe he that likens <hi>Ignace</hi> to <hi>Luther,</hi> is as impious as the other, that compared <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> together. <hi>Moſes</hi> was expreſly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of GOD to deliuer his people out of the captiuitie of Egypt, and the tyrannie of the <hi>Pharaos.</hi> For <hi>Moſes</hi> ſake, the ſea miraculouſly opened it ſelfe to make him way. God appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> and talked with him, and by his prayers, all the while he lifted vp his hands to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the ſame great GOD made the children of Iſraell victorious. I doe not thinke any man was euer ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that hee durſt make compariſon betweene <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Mahomet:</hi> and if there be any of that ſtamp, I take our Ieſuits to be as bad as he, in comparing <hi>Ignace</hi> with <hi>Moſes.</hi> This compariſon would be ſtrange to mee, but ouer-looking theyr other Ieſuiticall bookes, I found it to be a very familiar matter with them. For Father <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball Codret</hi> neuer doubted to write, that his companie
<pb facs="tcp:14558:44"/>tooke theyr name from God, who made them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of his deere ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, which ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them. And in their annuall Letters of the yeere 1589. the Ieſuits of the Colledge of our Lady of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto writing to theyr Generall, make mention of a little deuill coniurd by one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the Name of IESVS, whereat he was ſome-what angry: but when they preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with the name of <hi>Ignace,</hi> then began the deuill to play the deuill indeede, more then he did before, ſuch a feare had he of this holy name. Theſe blaſphemies are the leaſt eſcapes of our Ieſuits: this Familie hath good ſtore of others, whereof I truſt one day to make you a good and faithfull Inuentorie. But ſithence that by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from one matter to another, I ſtept before I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware vpon the proces and courſe of times, I will returne to our <hi>Ignace</hi> and his companions, to ſhewe you vvhat theyr craftie conueiance was to purchaſe entertainment when they came to Rome.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14558:44"/>might by his ignorance trouble the whole ſtate of the Church. In this conflict hee ſpent two yeeres at Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona, about the expiring whereof, iumping ouer his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he remoued to the Vniuerſitie of Alcala, where he made a ſhew of ſtudy in Logique, naturall Philoſophie, and Diuinitie. <hi>In Logique</hi> (ſaith Maffe) <hi>he began to turne ouer thoſe whom we call Termini. In naturall Phyloſophie, Albert. In Diuinitie, the maister of the Sentences.</hi> I leaue it to your conſiderations, whether theſe bookes were fit for him to handle, as a man that had doone all that was for him to doe, who ſtudied his Gramer but two yeeres, when as yet he had employed his fiue ſences, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his flight to any other deſſigne; for the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in learning, are much cumbred with vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Albertus,</hi> much more with the Maſter of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, the firſt foundation of our Schoole Diuinitie. Adde to it, that the two yeres he ſpent, one while at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala, another-while at Salamanca, another Vniuerſitie, theſe were but priſons &amp; extraordinary proceedings for him: that is as much to ſay, ſo much interruption of his imaginarie ſtudies hindred in him. I call them imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, becauſe he had no other ſpeculations in his ſoule, but by faire ſemblance to faſhion a new Sect. All thys vvas partly the cauſe, that hee perceiuing his drifts to take no place in Spayne, deſired to ſee Fraunce, &amp; came to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris in Februarie 1528. And then (ſay <hi>Maffe</hi> and <hi>Riba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener</hi>) knowing how little hee had profited in 4. yeeres,<note place="margin">Maff. lib. 1. ca. 18. Rib. lib. 18. cap. 16.</note> as well by reaſon of the precipitation, as the confuſion of his ſtudies, he deliberated to follow the broad way: Let vs take <hi>Maffees</hi> booke into our hands, &amp; marke what he diſcourſeth. <hi>And when by his experience he had found the imbecilitie of mans mind to be ſuch, that he can hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to haue many yrons in the fire at once, condemning his former haſt, and forſaking fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence forth the ſhorteſt cut, he entred the Kings high way, and attempted to begin his ſtudies anew. Therefore beeing at mans ſtate, hee diſdained not to
<pb facs="tcp:14558:45"/>repaire euerie day to the Colledge of Montagu, and in the company of babling children repeat his Grammer rules.</hi>

                  <hi>He did alſo much diminiſh his ſet time of prayer, &amp; taming of his bodie, to recouer the more leaſure and ſtrength: yet ſo, that he principally neuer omitted theſe three things.

                  <hi>fel ſo ſodainly poore, that he was conſtrained to beg his bread euerie day from doore to doore, &amp; to get into S. Iames hoſpitall by very humble ſuit, entreating the Preſident of that place, which was indeed a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to him. Therefore, in Saint Iames hoſpitall, which ſtands farre off in the Suburbes,</hi> Ignatius <hi>being driuen to verie great ſtreights, by reaſon of ſo great diſtance of place, he ſtrugled with other incommodities, as well in that the ſchooles began in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuerſitie before day, and ended not but within the night, he by the ſtatutes of the hoſpitall, could not get out of the gates eaſily before ſunnne riſing, and muſt returne at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before the ſunne was ſet: as alſo that by going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming though he were a painefull and diligent Scholler, yet he loſt much of his Maisters dictates, and of the exerciſes of the ſchooles. Hauing no other preſent remedy for ſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, he determined after the manner of poore Schollers, to ſerue ſome of the heads, Dostors of the Vniuerſitie: vpon condition, that ſuch vacant times as he had from his Maiſters buiſines, might wholly be ſpent in the ſchooles to get learning.</hi> And a little after, ſeeing how <hi>Ignace</hi> went forward with his ſtudies. <hi>He tooke a farre better courſe, that when the vacations began, he might runne out into Belgia, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time into England, or Britane, to the Spaniſh factors, by whoſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14558:45"/>bountie, hauing eaſily obtained a yeerely ſumme of money to be paid him by certaine penſions at Paris, all the time of his ſtudies, he might the more commodiouſly giue himſelfe to his booke: and when he had ſpent almoſt eighteene moneths at the Latine tongue in the Colledge of Montagu, he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Colledge, cald by the name of Saint</hi> Barbara, <hi>to ſtudie Philoſiphie, tarying there three yeeres and a halfe (which is the full time appointed in that Vniuerſitie for the courſe of Philoſophy) he profited ſo well, that by the honourable verdict of his Maiſter</hi> (<hi>which was</hi> Iohn Penna <hi>the Philoſopher</hi>) <hi>when he had plaid his ordinarie prizes, he was graced with a lawrell, and other ornaments of learning. After this, he did ſet vpon the ſtudie of Diuinitie in the ſchooles of the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans Monaſterie, with great trauell. Ribadiner</hi> the ſupply of <hi>Maffees</hi> vntruthes, adds, <hi>That hauing goue through his courſe of Philoſophie, he gaue the reſt of his time, vntill he was fiue and thirtie yeeres of age, vnto Diuinitie, wherein by Gods goodnes, the harueſt was anſwerable to his ſeed.</hi> His meaning was to tell you, that he wonne as great honour in Diuinitie, as he did in Philoſophie, wherein he ſaid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie true, ſithence he got no more commendation in the one profeſſion, then in the other.</p>

Neuertheleſſe, at the end of his ſtudies, he makes him a great Philoſopher. It is not inough for a witneſſe to depoſe ſuch a thing was done: he muſt render a reaſon of his ſpeech, if he will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued. Let vs go ouer all that I haue here read vnto you. Firſt <hi>Maffee</hi> confeſſeth, that all <hi>Ignace</hi> his ſtudies for
<pb facs="tcp:14558:46"/>the ſpace of foure yeeres in Spaine were vnprofitable, ſo that he was conſtrained to go back to the loweſt formes of the colledge of Montaigu with little childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to learne the firſt principles of his Latine Grammer, wherein he ſpent eighteene moneths onely, before he entred the courſe of Philoſophie. I will ſhew you that of all this time you ſhall not find aboue ſixe moneths of ſtudie. During theſe eighteene moneths he neuer loſt one Maſſe, he kept all his Saboths, this could not be done without deuotion, ſo that he muſt at the leaſt take vp the Saturday to prepare himſelfe: or if he went to lectures that day, it had beene to abuſe the Sacrament of the Altar, to preſent himſelfe before it the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, euerie day he fell to examining his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and if you will haue me put him into his circle, a braue ſtudie certainly farre paſſing all other: but while he gaue himſelfe time for it, this was to diſtract him from his other ſtudie whereof we now ſpeake. His firſt abode, was at Saint <hi>Iames</hi> of Haultpas, halfe a quarter of a league diſtant from the Colledge of Montaigu. What a deale of time loſt he in going to and fro? The hoſpitall gate opened late in the morning, and ſhut ſoone in the euening, which made him copie out many leſſons euerie day: but that which is much more, when you conſider that he was compeld to craue almes at mens houſes for his reliefe: his dinner was not readie for him. To quite himſelfe of this inconuenience, he was forſt to ſerue a Colledge, a ſtate wherein he might more eaſily find ſuſtenance for his bodie, but not for his ſoule: for being come out of a hoſpital, from a kind of beggerie to ſeruice, neuer doubt but that he was employed in the moſt baſe and vile offices of a Colledge ſeruant, which are, to make the beds, to ſweep the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to bruſh his Maiſters apparrell, and to beate out the duſt, to hang the pot ouer the fire, to runne fr wine, to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14558:46"/>waſh the diſhes, and other ſmall duties depending vpon this charge. Iudge you what breathing time hee could haue for his booke. In fine, during theſe 18. monthes he made many voiages in the vacations, as well into the Low-Countries, as into England, to recouer exhibition. I would be very glad <hi>Maffee</hi> ſhould tell mee what time of vacation was giuen vnto the Schollers, for it is newes to me. Theſe voyages coulde not be made but by long iournies by a foote-man, driuen to begge his liuing; and the very cut ouer the Sea to paſſe into England, is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Put all theſe circumſtances together, howe much time had he left him for his Grammer ſtudies of the 18. monthes? at the end whereof, they make him leape with a pitch-forke into Phyloſophy, which was vnfit for it, and beyond all hope he grew a great Phyloſopher, and afterward a profound Diuine. Such Schollers as haue paſt the ſtreights of Grammer and Rethorique, &amp; haue thereunto ioyned the reading of Oratory Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Poets Greeke and Latine, become in fiue or ſixe yeeres ſpace, hardly able to enter the courſe of Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie: and would they haue vs thinke this man, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had ſixe monthes free leyſure to learne his Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer among chyldren, becam a great Phyloſopher? All theſe things giue the lye openly to this hyſtorie. For the ſame man, during the time of the three yeeres &amp; a halfe of his courſe, was put into the Inquiſition, beefore Fryer <hi>Mathew Ory,</hi> Inquiſitour of the fayth; And he was to be whypt in the Hall of the Colledge of S. Barbe, by the hands of Maiſter <hi>Iames Gouea,</hi> Principall of the houſe,<note place="margin">Maff. lib. 1. cap. 20. Rib. lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> vpon the complaint of Ma. <hi>Iohn Penna</hi> his Tutor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he put his fellowes out of theyr ordinarie courſe of ſtudies. <hi>And I know not with what emptie ſhewe of holines, he peruerted the excellent ſtate and diſcipline of that Schoole,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ribad. lib. 2. cap. 3.</note> ſaith <hi>Ribadener.</hi> Furthermore, in the three yeeres of his courſe, he intangled in his net one <hi>Faure, Xauier, Lainez,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:47"/>Salmeron, Bobadilla, Roderic</hi> his firſt companions, or rather to ſay truth, his firſt Diſciples, with whom he afterward made the firſt ſtampe of his Societie at Montmarter.</p>
               <p>I learne all this, ſpecially of <hi>Maffee,</hi> yet is this braue calculator, ſo vnaduiſed to tell vs, that to make himſelfe capable of Philoſophie, hee forgot all the old illuſions of the diuell, to giue himſelfe the better leaſure to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, without conſideration calling that the diuels illuſion, which <hi>Ignace</hi> auouched to be deuotion. Lay aſide his Philoſophie, and call to mind his ſtudie in Diuinity. He proceeded Maſter of Arts in March 1532. then he fell into a long and tedious ſicknes, &amp; by the Phiſitions counſell he changed ayre, and went into Spayne in the moneth of Nouember 1535. Can you make him a great Diuine in three yeers, which neuer laid any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Grammer or Philoſophie? And to ſhew you that he was a great Aſſe, I meane in reſpect of all kind of learning, and not concerning the wiſedome of the world, wherein no bodie came neere him, this is couertly acknowledged by the Ieſuits themſelues, who feed you with no fables. When Painters draw the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> they lay a booke open in his hands, to ſhew he was a man reputed the moſt learned of all our Church Doctors. And when the Ieſuits repreſent the figure of their <hi>Ignace,</hi> they giue him a paire of beads in his hand, in token of his ignorance, for vpon theſe, ſilie wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay their praiers, which can neither read nor write.

A worke that not onely required they ſhould bring a willing mind with them, but ſufficiencie and capacitie to performe it. For this cauſe they were euer carefull not to be counted
<pb facs="tcp:14558:48"/>ſimple ſchollers, for then men would haue mockt them and neuer haue called them Diuines. They were too weak to grace themſelues ſo far, hauing no ground, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after a ſmoother manner, they tearmed themſelues Maiſters of Arts, not of Spaine or Italy, but of the great &amp; famous Vninerſity of Paris. And in the neck of it, they added, that they had ſtudied Diuinity many yeeres. The Pope, to be reſolued what fruite this newe order might bring forth, committed the matter to three Cardinals. Of theſe three, one was of Luca, <hi>Barthelmy Guidicion,</hi> a very learned &amp; holy man (by the Ieſuits own teſtimony) who a little before this, had made a booke againſt new orders of religion.

               <p>Thus if you giue any credit to them, of theſe tenne companions, 4. were Graduats in Paris, three in Spaine, and the three other without degree of Maiſterſhip. And
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14558:49"/>I will ſhew you as I paſſe along, that <hi>Paſquier Broet</hi> was a great Aſſe for all his porredge. I ſpeake of him, becauſe I once turnd &amp; wound him, and put him out of breath, when he, in the houſe of Clairmont in Harpe-ſtreete at Paris, was Preſident of the Ieſuits. This fellowe was a great Idole, of whom a man may ſay, as in old time <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Ruffus</hi> the Rethoritian.</p>

Behold now what time theſe ten Champions ſpent in the ſtudy of Diuinitie: for they tolde Pope <hi>Paule</hi> that they had ſtudied it many yeeres. Maffee teſtifies vnto vs, that when they made theyr firſt vowe at Montmartir, the greateſt part of them had now gone through theyr courſe of Diuinitie, and the others had begunne it with a good minde to finiſh it, that they might march forward together, to the conqueſt of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh ſoules in Paleſtine, by our holy Father the Popes leaue. The paſſage deſerues to be viewed here at length. <hi>Ignatius</hi> hauing by the goodnes of God gotten theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, (ſpeaking of the ſixe firſt companions) deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to put that in practiſe with al ſpeed, which he had long hamered &amp; caſt in his mind, that by the Popes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he might goe to Ieruſalem, &amp; either call the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Nations, which in time paſt ſincerely profeſt Chriſtianitie, &amp; after were deceiued by Mahomets wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſuperſtition, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their miſerable error to the truth of the Goſpel: or take that which followed, ſhed his blood, and looſe his life in ſo holy and glorious a cauſe. Neither
<pb facs="tcp:14558:50"/>was it hard for him to bring the reſt to the bent of his bow, which came forward already of their own accord, and were inflamed with the loue of God. And becauſe moſt of them had not yet finiſht their ſtudies in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that the zeale now begun in them might not coole againe, and alſo that their obedience might be ſo much the more acceptable to the maieſtie of GOD, by how much the greater neceſſitie of ſeruitude &amp; religion they impoſed vpon themſelues, calling vpon the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine for her protection, &amp; vpon S. <hi>Deniſe</hi> the Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite, the Pariſians Patron, in a Church in the ſuburbs, called Montmarter, by the miſteries of confeſſion &amp; of the Euchariſt, euery one bound himſelfe, that at the end of his diuinity courſe, when he ſhould goe forth Doctor of Diuinitie, preſently he ſhould forſake the world, and ſeek the ſaluation of ſoules, in perpetuall pouertie; &amp; by an appointed time ſaile to Ieruſalem, with an intent to imploy all theyr endeuours to conuert the Infidels, and with care and ſtudie purchaſe a crowne of martirdome.</p>
               <p>If this reſolution ſhould any way be hindered, they ſhould goe to Rome at the yeeres end, &amp; offer their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile to the chiefe Biſhop, Chriſtes Vicar, for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good of their neighbors, without any contract for reward, or exceptions of times or places. This vow they made in that Church, with great conſent &amp; alacritie, in the yeere after Chriſtes natiuitie 1534. 18. Kalends of September, vpon which day, the anniuerſary gratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the virgin Maries aſſumption is celebrated. And they celebrated the ſame vow in the ſame place, the ſame day together, the next and the third yeere after.</p>
               <p>Tis fit this ſhould be tranſlated into French, for it is neceſſary for my diſcourſe that euery man ſhoulde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it.

That any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was a Doctor at this time, is too loude a lie, for if it had been ſo indeed, this title had neuer beene ſmothered, when they put vp their ſupplication to Pope <hi>Paulus,</hi> in reſpect of thoſe which had already taken this degree, &amp; they would haue taken good heede to challenge no other ſtile then Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Arts. I wil goe farther with you, for I wil make it appeare, that none of theſe 7. or of the other 3. that after came to them, had euer ſtudied diuinitie. For if they had euer begun the courſe, as Maffee auoucheth, &amp; ſtudied it many yeeres, this word <hi>many</hi> imports not two or three yeeres onely, but foure or fiue at leaſt; we neuer ſay, that a man is in companie of many perſons, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied but with 2. or three. The manner of the Diuines of Paris, is, when a man hath begun his courſe, at the 2. yeeres end, hee muſt defend publiquely in the diuinitie Schooles appointed for this purpoſe, where he anſwers vnder a Doctor, his moderator, to helpe him when he is hard driuen by the Opponent. Hauing plaid his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers prizes, which is called his probation, he is made Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheler, and from that day allowed to were a hood vpon his ſhoulders when he goes into the towne, and a redde habite of Bachelers in Schooles. When our ten Ieſuits came to Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third, they neuer told him they were Bachelers in diuinity, they had not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> begun their courſe, nor ſtudied diuinitie ſo much as 2. yeeres: where ſhall we now finde theſe many yeeres they ſpeake of?</p>
               <p>There can be no anſwer to this obiection but one, that is, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe freely, that Maffee lies, when he ſaith ſom of
<pb facs="tcp:14558:51"/>them were Doctors of diuinity, &amp; ſome had begun their courſe. It may be ſome will ſay, that without matricula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Diuinitie courſe in the Colledge of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons, euerie one of them particularly had ſtudied it ſome more, ſome leſſe, after they were Maiſters of Arts. For my part, I ſtriue not for the victory, but for the truth, and I doubt not, but that <hi>Maffee</hi> &amp; <hi>Ribadiner</hi> alſo haue made no bones to lye in this point. Let vs then examine what time <hi>Ignace</hi> and his companie could ſpend in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, without entering into this courſe. <hi>Maffee</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badiner</hi> talke of this matter, as blind men ſpeake of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. I will deliuer you the true hiſtorie. I haue ſearched the old Regiſters of Paris, for thoſe that proceeded Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Art, in and after the yeere 1520. vntill the yeere 1556. when <hi>Ignace</hi> his companions, went out of Fraunce to meet him at Venice. I ſearched the records of <hi>du <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ale,</hi> the Vniuerſities Regiſter, and <hi>Violet</hi> the beadle of Fraunce, for they two keepe the bookes. This did I in the preſence of other men of account: And marke what I found according to the order of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet which they obſerue.</p>

As for <hi>Maffees</hi> and <hi>Rabadiners</hi> ſpeech, auouching <hi>Paſquier Broet</hi> to be of the Dioces of Amiens, were that true, they would haue remembred it in their ſupplication to Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> where no mention is made of this Dioces. The truth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14558:51"/>then is, that among three of them, two, without doubt, neuer tooke degree in Fraunce, but in Spayne; <hi>Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez</hi> and <hi>Bobadilla:</hi> and <hi>Paſquier Broet</hi> which is the third, proceeded in neither of both. For that, that remaines touching the ſtudie of Diuinitie, what is become of thoſe many yeeres of <hi>Iay</hi> and <hi>Roderic,</hi> who proceeded but Maiſters in March, 1534. and of <hi>Salmeron</hi> and <hi>Codury,</hi> which came after them in the ſame degree in the yeere 1535? for both our Hiſtoriographers agree, that in the moneth of Nouember 1536. they forſooke Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, to tender themſelues in Italy to their Maiſter <hi>Ignace.</hi> As for <hi>Ignace</hi> himſelfe, you cannot tell how to giue him aboue three yeers time of ſtudie in Diuinity at the moſt, and much of that loſt by a lingring ſicknes, for which the Phiſitians councelled him to chaunge the ayre, whereupon he returned in o Spayne, in Nouember, 1535. yet did theſe great Clarkes promiſe by their learning, to conuert heretiques and infidels to our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Thinke you that if the three Cardinals put in commiſſion by the Pope to examine them, had ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the bottome of them, they ſhould not haue deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried, that vpon their comming into Italy, they had euen with the ayre, drunke downe I know not what manners and diſpoſitions of the Mounte-banks, who vtter their Triacle in euerie towne, &amp; take vp their ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the market place, with a long Oration promiſing to heale al manner of griefes and diſeaſes, with their oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pouders, oyles, and waters: faire ſhewes, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly come to nothing.</p>

I ſee our firſt Fathers the founders of our order, were not all Maiſters of Arts in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: I ſee ſome of them were no Graduates: I ſee neuer a one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was Bacheler, much leſſe Doctor of Diuinitie: I ſee none of them ſtudied it: Briefly, if it may pleaſure you, I grant all you would haue me. What of all this I pray you, ſith Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third authorized them, &amp; ten yeeres after, <hi>Iulius</hi> his ſucceſſor confirmed our new profeſſion? Popes that deſerue to be beleeued, aboue all the rules of Lawe, by reaſon of their abſolute power and dignitie. Let me tell you freely, that though our good Fathers were but ſimple Schollers, men ſhould hardly finde you match them, ſith you inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour by your curious ſpeech, to call their ſtate in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion after it was allowed. You muſt vnderſtand, that the Pope ſupplies, by the ſcroule of his thoughts, whatſoeuer wants, either in law or action.</p>
               <p>This had beene well ſpoken (quoth the Aduocate) if the Clarks of the Court of Rome coppying out the Bull, had by ſome expreſſe declaration, put in a clauſe derogatorie to the truth of the matter. Yet is not this propoſition altogether approued; as for my ſelfe, I will take good heed that I neuer doubt of the authoritie of the holy Sea, confirmed by infinite places as well of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, as of the works of the auncient Doctors of the Church. Yet the caſe ſtanding as it doth in that which followes, we haue great reaſon to be perſwaded
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14558:52"/>that the approbation <hi>Paule</hi> the third made of their Sect, is of no force, not for lacke of authoritie in him, but by reaſon of a plaine ſurreption vſuall among you. Marke I beſeech you what I ſhall ſay vnto you, aſſoone as euer <hi>Ignace</hi> forſook the warres, to betake him to another kind of life: he had a purpoſe to become a Captaine of our Church militant. The firſt ſhew he made of it, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeere 1536. in the Vniuerſitie of Alcala, where he drew three Spaniſh Schollers to him, <hi>Artiague, Calliſte, Cazere:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Maff. lib. r. cap. 17. Rib. lib. 1. cap. 14.</note> and from that time had he a motion of Ieſuitiſme in his head. He had heard, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt pointing to our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, in the ſight of the Iewes, cald him the Lambe of God that came downe from heauen, to take away our ſins: Hereupon this wiſe man, taking the barke from the ſappe, thought he could not immitate our Sauiour Chriſt more truly, then by wearing a wollen garment that was neuer died, but of the ſame colour it hath when it is taken from the ſheeps back, thus were his three companions, and hee ſutably clad in Say, <hi>Quos propterea</hi> (ſaith Ribadiner) <hi>

There muſt be much time to furniſh them for the accompliſhment of this vow; For by the order of the facultie of Diuinitie in Paris, after the degree of Maiſterſhip, there was a ſurceaſe of fiue yeeres, which was afterward reduced to foure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man might begin his Diuinity courſe. Of the ſeuen firſt, &amp; three laſt compamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, there were but two, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this graue order, were ſit to begin this courſe: that was, <hi>Peter Faure,</hi> and <hi>Francis Xauier,</hi> Maiſters of the yeere 1529. and ſo were not to be admitted before the yeere 1535. As for all the reſt, not one of them had made his fiue yeeres preparation after his Maiſterſhip: and one of them, <hi>Paſquier Troet,</hi> was no Maiſter at all, and two others, <hi>Lainez</hi> and <hi>Bobadilla,</hi> hauing gone forth Maiſters in Spaine, were not adopted in the Vniuerſitie of Paris, &amp; ſo conſequently were incapable of admiſſion.

The fame of the deuotion of this newe companie, that ſaid they had vowed theſe conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, was ſpred ouer many Nations: the King ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them by Letters to come to him, that vnder his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection they might be diſpatcht into the Indies. But <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> beeing ſubtile &amp; whilie, turnd the deafe eare to this motion, remembring no more his firſt vowe made at Montmarter, nor his ſecond vowe renued at Rome, by which hee got a good ſum of money, and ſent forth <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier</hi> and <hi>Roderic</hi> onely, keeping the other ſeauen about him. Doe not you ſee by this, that <hi>Ignace</hi> was a ſtates man, no religious man, who dalied with his vowe made at Montmarter?</p>
               <p>By the matters heere diſcourſed, you haue heard what was their vow at Montmarter, to goe for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ſoules after their doctorſhip in Diuinitie. That ſome of them ſaid they were Maiſters of Arts in Paris; that they had beſtowed many yeeres in the ſtudie of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie; meere fables. The pauſe <hi>Iulius</hi> the third made in their allowance, euen when hee tooke them at theyr word, to be ſuch men as they reported themſelues to be, and that he was verie much preſſed by Cardinall <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> their Solicitor and Protector, what would hee haue done then think you, if his holines had receiued any true intelligence of their hiſtory? Me thinks that with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable maieſtie, of thoſe venerable yeeres hee carried, I
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14558:54"/>ſee him ſpeake to them in this manner.</p>
               <p>All new orders of Religion are to be ſuſpected, and for this cauſe were they forbidden by two generall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, the one held at Rome, the other at Lyons; you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vs a new religious Order, vnder the name of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of Ieſus, as true followers of him and his Apoſtles. Your intention is derogatorie to your profeſſion, or to ſpeake more properly, your profeſſion is contrarie to your petition, and implies a contradiction. For if you be the Apoſtles Schollers, one of the firſt leſſons they taught vs was, that looke what hath beene ordred in a generall Counſell by the heads of the Church, ought to be kept inuiolable, vntill it be repeald by another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell vppon iuſt occaſion. As if all did ſhoote out of one ſtocke of the holie Ghoſt, <hi>Placuit ſpiritui ſancto et nobis,</hi> they ſpake in ſuch caſes, as men that diuorced not the holy Ghoſts cauſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Churches, nor the Churches cauſe from the holy Ghoſts. If you trace after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſo preciſely as you proteſt, how comes it to paſſe that by a new found order, you goe about to breake the auncient canonicall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitutions of the Church? I know it well, that beeing Chriſtes Vicar, I may diſpence with you, and I much commend your obedience to the holy Sea. But ſetting aſide that which hath beene decreed in generall, &amp; looking in particular toward you, all things degenerate from that you now intend: I perceiue that your beginning had ſome taſte of God, your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſauours much of man, and your end ſmacks three or foure times more of the deuill.</p>
               <p>Betaking your ſelues to a deuotion full of perrill, you made choice of the Martirs Church neer Paris, to ſhew you would all be ready to ſhed your blood for the truths ſake, as oft as occaſion ſerued. A braue and holy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which cannot be praiſed enough. Vpon this point you went to confeſſion, all of you heard Maſſe deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, after that you receiued the Sacrament, vpon the day
<pb facs="tcp:14558:55"/>of the Aſſumption of our Lady, the moſt ſolemne feaſt of hers: deſirous that the bleſſed virgine ſhould bee a witneſſe to your vow, you continued it two yeeres after, the ſelfe ſame day and place. Heere be holy circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces enow to tie you to the vow you made then: Let vs conſider nowe what this vowe was. You promiſed to God, that when euery one of you had ended his diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie courſe, you would renounce the world, and goe to Paleſtine to conuert the enemies of our fayth, and that if you ſhould within one yeere after your Doctorſhips, be any way hindered of your voyage, you ſhould ſeeke vnto me to receiue my direction. For the firſt execution of ſo faire a plot, you made choice of the Citty of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, for the generall <hi>Rende-vous</hi> of theſe Pilgrims that were to goe to Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>Before you proceeded any further, thou <hi>Ignace,</hi> (for to thee I ſpeake in particular,<note place="margin">Maſſ. lib. 2. capit. 2.</note> as to the ring-leader of them all) didſt wiſely take thy iourney into Spayne, to take order for your affaires and fellowes. And after that, with great zeale you tooke ſhippe at Valentia to goe for Venice, without any feare of <hi>Barberoſſe</hi> the Turks ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Seas, all of you met at Venice; you came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that to me to receiue my bleſſing, and paſſe for your trauell and inhabiting Paleſtine. You obtained at my hands all that you craued, you receiued much gold and ſiluer, giuen you by diuers men for your firſt earneſt of the voyage, vpon this bleſſing you returned back to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, with a purpoſe to performe your promiſe. I would ſaine know who diuerted you? You ſay the warre ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly made betweene the Venetians and the Turke. What Gallies mand, what ſhips rigged, what preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſawe you for this exployt? The Turke and wee are continuall enemies, yet doth hee not refuſe to giue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſafe conduct to poore Pilgrims, paying him his auncient trybute: did this warre driue away the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons that dwell neere the holy Sepulcher?</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:14558:55"/>
               <p>Furthermore, who compeld you to alter your vow, for that which is prolonged from one yeere to another,<note place="margin">Paul. Ioui. lib. 32. hiſt.</note> is not quite broken off. Likewiſe, the Venetian and the Turk are now vpon entreatie of peace, &amp; the matter ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther already concluded, or at a point ſo to be. Beſides, if the paſſages be ſtopt that way, they lie open for you to the Indies, there is no feare in that paſſage, the King him ſelfe leades you by the hand, why doe you draw back? You that ſo late made ſhewe to goe to Paleſtine, a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſubiect to a thouſand dangers of your liues, go now in Gods name to this new world, and come not heere to plant a new world in our old Church.</p>
               <p>It is not the warre betweene the Venetian and the Turke that driues you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your firſt vow, it is your ſelues that vow what you luſt. This ſauors of man more then I would it did. At your firſt comming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Venice to my Court, you little knowe what cheere was made you by me and mine: and whether good or bad, which of the two, I haue no leaſure to tell you; you founde more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour then you looked for; good countenaunce, kinde entertainement, gold &amp; ſiluer to ſpend by the way. For this cauſe you returned to Venice, you tooke your ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt cut to recoyle back againe to Rome, with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſubmiſſion to the holy Sea, forgetting your ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall vowe. But let vs yeelde a little to you as you are men, &amp; let vs take your new excuſe for payment. How can I winke at the lies you flap me in the mouth withall, to circumuent mee and betray mee. You ſay you are all Maiſters of Arts, of the great &amp; famous Vniuerſitie of Paris, I find three of you neuer tooke degree. You ſay you haue ſtudied diuinitie many yeeres: where ſhall I finde theſe manie? in two of the companie, that vvere but Maiſters in the yeere 1534. &amp; two others in the yere 1535. and theſe came to Venice in the yeere 1536. Where ſhal I find then (I ſay) theſe many? in <hi>Ignace,</hi> that forſooke Paris three yeeres before he was Maiſter, or in
<pb facs="tcp:14558:56"/>that other, that neuer tooke degree? To be ſhort, I ſee but two of your companie, <hi>Faure</hi> and <hi>Xauier</hi> that euer could haue any leyſure to follow this ſtudie. I knowe it well, that if you make any lie on your part, you will ſay it is to be borne withall, becauſe it is done to a good end. A ghoſtly deceit, and I tell you at a word, that Chiſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e brookes no fraudulent pietie. Set theſe two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers apart, let vs come to the naked truth. Howe can I diſſemble the breach of your vow, wherein it cannot be but the deuill had a finger? You promiſed and ſwore to God, that you woulde goe no further with your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, before you had ended your Diuinitie courſe: where is the end, nay where is the beginning of it? Prick mee out the time, when euery one of you ſeuerally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it. If you began it, who hindered your finiſhing of it? for there was nothing in Paris to feare you. The vvarre betweene the Emperour and the French King, God be thanked, is ceaſed: Nothing conſtrained you to make ſuch a hote vow at Montmatter, it proceeded from your zeale, which tied you to nothing at the firſt, but now the vow is made, you are bound to keepe it.</p>
               <p>Before it was made, was not this worke neceſſarie for the winning of ſoules, which you promiſe to performe? You like auriculer confeſſion in our Miniſterie, a moſt holie thing: the tranſsubſtantiation of the bodie of our Sauiour Chriſt in the Sacrament, a moſt holy thing: If the word (moſt) import no more. Theſe be meanes to keepe the Catholiques to theyr old religion, yet are they not ſufficient, to conuert men of a long time nouſled vp in Idolatry and Mahometiſme. Euery one of them hath in his impious ſuperſtition, certaine Maximes contrarie to the Chriſtian fayth. Beſides this, doe not you know, that the deuill <hi>Martine Luther,</hi> (ſo I meane to call him, as an impe of the deuil of S. <hi>Martins</hi>) is in complet Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt the two Sacraments, by an infinite ſort of Sophiſtications, ill deduced from the holie Scripture,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14558:56"/>if you learne of him to doſſe out your hornes, as you haue promiſed, this is no young Schollers worke, nor for a ſimple Maiſter of Arte, but for one of the wiſeſt and beſt learned Diuines to take in hand. For otherwiſe, while you thinke to defend our cauſe, you will betray it. What weapons muſt you haue to foyle theſe miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants? The foure Euangeliſts, with the Commentaries of the good Doctors of the Church, S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory</hi> the great, the firſt Pope of that name, S. <hi>Iohn Chriſostome,</hi> S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> and many others, whom the Church hath enroled in the Kalender of Saints.</p>
               <p>All theſe hold a courſe of morrall Theologie, a verie trenchant ſworde to deſtroy the euill life of Chriſtians: but that blade which I meane to ſpeake of now, is fitteſt to bring you to cloſe fight, with poynt to poynt; One <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> maiſter of the Sentences, and S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi> men worthy to be followed in Schoole lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Theſe be two Champions, by whoſe help we may be ſufficiently armed to buckle with our enemies, &amp; this is no ſtudie of two or three yeeres, ancient diſcipline re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at the leaſt ſixe yeres trauell in them for publique exerciſe, beſides all the reſt of our life in particular.</p>
               <p>Sith you haue vowed to GOD to diſtill your wits through this Limbec, why would you haue me diſpence with you? You that haue dedicated your ſelues, as wel to conuert Infidels as Hereticks, why haue you not doone it? It became you to doe it, except you meant to preſent vs with <hi>Phaetons</hi> fable of newe Coach men, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to driue the horſes of the Sunne, caſt the whole earth into a combuſtion. Had you any ſparke of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in you, you haue no power at all to reuoke your vow made alreadie vnto God; the place, the day, the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Church, (twiſe or thriſe frequented) the things you bring with you, bind you, without hope of diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for me, I neither wil nor can diſpence with you,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:57"/>the law of God, and the Goſpell, our canonicall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, my fayth, my religion, &amp; the vniuerſall Church whereof I am the head, forbids mee.</p>
               <p>Howe thinke you, would not Pope <hi>Paule</hi> haue flatly reiected them, if hee had beene aduertiſd of theyr falſe degrees, and their fained ſtudies of diuinitie, and of their vowe made at Montmarter, ſeeing there belongs much labour to gaine it before it be conſented to. Heereupon I doubt not, but that their order beeing receiued and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a manifeſt ſurprize and obreption, theyr au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſing is voide. Conſequently, that all that is built vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thys foundation, is of no effect or validitie. That the Ieſuits, let them fortifie themſelues as much as they will, by the Bull obtaind of him ſucceſſiuely after the firſt, of the yeere 1540. ſeeing the roote it ſelfe it rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the tree can beare no fruite at all.</p>
               <p>Hetherto I haue ſhewed you what an Aſſe <hi>Ignace</hi> was, and what notable lyers hee had to his companions, men altogether ignorant in diuinitie. I will nowe make plaine to you, that theyr ſect, which they call the ſocietie of IESVS, ſtands vppon ignorance of the antiquitie of our Church.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot only the religious orders allowed by our Church, but true. Chriſtians, by what name or title ſoeuer they be called, are not of the Ieſuits Sect, (Chriſtian humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie forbids vs to ſpeake ſo proudly) but follow our Sauiour and Redeemer Ieſus Chriſt, after whoſe example and his Apoſtles, we ought to frame our life as neere as we can: that of his great &amp; infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, he may take pleaſure in vs. <hi>Ignace</hi> a very nouice, and young apprentiſe in the holy Scriptures, made choiſe of nine companions, as raw in theſe matters as himſelfe. They bringing in their Sect, imagined themſelues euerie way to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to the firſt grounds of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, &amp; for this cauſe, cald themſelues the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Ieſus. Let vs then examine what were the firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, &amp; third ſort of plants by which our Church grew and what the Ieſuits inſtitutions be: that by matching &amp; confronting the one with the other, we may iudge of ther title, they attribute to themſelues this partiall and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant name of the Societie of Ieſus, aboue all other Chriſtians. When our Sauiour was to aſcend vp into heauen, he commaunded all his Apoſtles to haue a care of his flocke. This charge was three times giuen in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as to the rocke vpon which he had before promiſed to build his Church. After that, hauing caſt the fiery flames of his holy ſpirit vpon them, their whole intent and purpoſe was, to ſow the ſeeds of his goſpell ouer all the world. Their ordinarie ſeat was
<pb facs="tcp:14558:58"/>at Ieruſalem, from whence they ſent foorth at the beginning, heere one, and there another of their company, into diuers parts of the Eaſt, which after their trauell, came backe againe to giue vp an account of their labours, in a courſe held by them. And although Saint Iames were by common ſuffrages choſen (ſaith <hi>Iuſtus</hi>) particularly to be gouernour of the Church of Ieruſalem: yet had Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſuperintendance and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall primacie among the Apoſtles, which was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him. And in the whole hiſtorie of their acts written by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> the principall miracles were done by him, and the generall rule of this holy company was put into his hands.</p>
               <p>Among them, were many perſons deuoted to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: ſome cald Biſhops, ſome Prieſts, of the Greeke word that ſignifies Elders. This we learne of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> chap. 15. &amp; 16. of the Acts, and in the 20. following, Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who taking his leaue of the Epheſians in the end of the Oration made to them, cals them Biſhops whom he named Prieſts in the beginning. Tis true that this gouernment continued not long among them, in ſo much, that as well for the good of the Paſtors of the Church, as for the flockes, the ſeuerall charges of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall prouinces, were giuen to ſuch men as were moſt fit, they were called Biſhops, and to men of meaner gifts were committed Townes, Villages, &amp; Pariſhes. Theſe the Church cald Prieſts, who exerciſed their miniſterie by the Biſhops authority, &amp; they were in time cald Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, you may ſee a verie faire picture of all this antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie drawen by venerable <hi>Beda.

Lo here the firſt plant of our Church, wherein you may gather agreeably to the courſe of times, the primacie and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the holy Sea of Rome: the Patriarches of Conſtantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Hieruſalem, the Archbiſhopricks, &amp; Biſhopricks, the particular Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and Curates, of Townes, Burroughs, &amp; Villages.</p>
               <p>The Church continued long in this ſtate, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the extraordinarie perſecutions of ſome Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours draue them to flye into the Deſerts, to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from thoſe cruelties, where beyond all expectation of the common people, they deuoted themſelues by vow to a ſolitarie life. Their Patrons were two great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Plias</hi> in the old Teſtament, &amp; <hi>S.

               <p>This courſe of life, tooke beginning (ſaith he) of aged <hi>Paule,</hi> Saint <hi>Anthonie</hi> promoted it, and if you will go higher, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was ſtandard-bearer to them all. A matter worth the nothing, that as God eſtabliſht in his Church two great and holy companies, one of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts, the other of Abbots, Monks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons: ſo it pleaſed him to make Saint <hi>Paule</hi> a choſen veſſell of his in the firſt ranke; and to lay the firſt planchers, &amp; open the firſt doore, to our Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by the other Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> in the ſecond ranke. Saint <hi>Anthonie</hi> (as I tolde you) ſucceeded him, from whom, as from one great fountaine, there iſſued many riuers, <hi>Macharius, Aniathas, Iulian, Paule</hi> the younger, and others, in whom, God made himſelfe knowen by many miracles. This extraordinarie ſolitude, could not eaſily be embraced by all deuout men, but by ſuch as were (if I may ſo terme them) Paradoxes.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14558:59"/>Thus ſome vowed a ſolitarie life, but after the manner of Monkes. For although they withdrew themſelues from the common people, yet liued they in a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhut vp within themſelues, ſequeſtred from the reſt of the people, which courſe being more eaſie to be borne withall, was more frequented then the firſt. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> writing to <hi>Ruſticus,</hi> a man deſirous to betake himſelfe to a ſolitaie life. <hi>Primum tractandum eſt, vtrum ſolus, an cum alijs in Monaſterio viuere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas.

For my part, I thinke it beſt you ſhould haue companie, and not be your owne Maiſter. When Sant <hi>Anthonie,</hi> liued in Aegypt, Saint <hi>Hillarion</hi> led the ſame life in Syria and Paleſtine that he did: and prouoked by the great fame that was ſpred of him ouer all Chriſtendome, he went to ſee him, and returned verie well inſtructed from him: Neuertheleſſe, by a new deuotion, he began to make himſelfe more ſociable after, then he was before: On this manner many Monaſteries, neuer knowen before, were by his example erected in Paleſtine, which he viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at certaine times, as the Generals of religious orders doe, accompanied with many Monkes. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> diſcourſeth this at large, in his life: and this brings me halfe into a beliefe, that the Monaſteries tooke their firſt beginning from him, and grew to be ſuch as we ſee at this day. I may well ſay, that at one and the ſelfe ſame time, there were Anacorits in Aegypt vnder Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie,</hi> and Monkes in Paleſtine vnder Saint <hi>Hilarion,</hi>

               <p>Now had all theſe men (I meane ſuch as dwelt alone in the Deſartes, and ſuch as liued in Couents) apparrell diſtinct and different from the Common people.

Thus likewiſe, the leaſt part of their care, was to become learned; this leſſon they learned of their great Patron Saint <hi>Anthonie,</hi> who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that hee knew nothing, beeing of opinion, that the ſtudie of learning, would hinder ſpirituall medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14558:60"/>and being ſuch kinde of men, they tooke no orders of Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>This made Saint <hi>Iohn Chryſostome,</hi> (comparing a Prieſt and a true Monke together) ſay, that a Prieſt in reſpect of a Monke, is like a King ſorted with a ſimple man that liues a priuate life: therefore the Monks office was, neither to preach, nor to teach the common people. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> writing to <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> a Monke, ſaith, If you will take the charge of a Prieſt vpon you, if you deſire to be called to the high degree of a Biſhoppe, dwell in townes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that by winning other mens ſoules, you may ſaue your owne: But if you will be a Monke, that is to ſay, ſolitarie, what make you in townes, which are no habitations for ſole men, but for troupes and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes?</p>
               <p>The Biſhops and Prieſtes, haue a looking glaſſe of the Apoſtles, they then ſucceeding in their charge, make themſelues ſucceſſors of their merits. And as for vs, let vs ſet before our eies Saint <hi>Paule, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie, Iulian, Hilarion, Macharius,</hi> Captaines of our profeſſion; and not to forget what the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tels vs, an <hi>Elias</hi> and an <hi>Eliſeus.</hi> Our Table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the ground, our diet is hearbes, and ſometime a fewe ſmall fiſhes, which wee account for great banquets. The ſame Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> beeing intreated by a good ſonne, to preach to his Mother,<note place="margin">Sanct.

               <p>Time (as I haue told you) culd out two ſorts of theſe men, the one dwelt ſolitarily in the deſartes, cald Ancors, the others, in Couents, which the Greeks cald <hi>Coenobites,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:61"/>whoſe order and diſcipline Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> deſcribes in that notable Epiſtle, that begins <hi>(Audi filia.)</hi> And although the Monkes were neither Prieſts nor Clarks, yet by courſe and compaſſe of time, their ſuperiours were permitted to be Prieſted, that they might admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments to them.</p>
               <p>Thus became Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> an Abbot and Prieſt togither: Likewiſe <hi>Iohn,</hi> Biſhop of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, reproouing <hi>Epiphamus</hi> Biſhop of Cypres his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, for Prieſting ſome Monkes in Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> Monaſterie, hee made his excuſe by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Monkes, which then wanted Prieſts to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto them. And Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in a funerall Oration he made for <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of Vercellis, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other particularities for which he commended him,<note place="margin">Saint Amb. ſerm. 69.</note> this was one, that he had Prieſted all the Monkes of his Dioces. In proceſſe of time, Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ioyning holy orders to deuotion, became great nurſeries of our Church: In that ſome of them were made Archbiſhops, ſome Biſhops, who by their holy liues, and deepe learning, promoted Chriſtian Religion greatly. Such were <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen,</hi> and <hi>Baſill,</hi> both Monkes, and both Biſhops, which ſeuerally erected an infinite number of Monaſteries, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders, the one, in the Realme of Pontus the other, in Cappadocia: and in them begunne the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Religions, which is in part tranſmitted ouer euen vnto vs. I omit heere of purpoſe to touch the nouelties brought in by time, contenting my ſelfe with ſhewing you the firſt roote of all.</p>
               <p>It remaines, that I ſpeake a word or two to you of our Vniuerſities, erected as well for diuinitie Lectures as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humaine Sciences. Neither in the Apoſtles times, nor long after, as our Church particularly charged with Lectures. The Apoſtles office, &amp; ſucceſſiuely the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14558:61"/>Biſhops, conſiſted in preaching the Goſpell and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the holy Sacraments. VVee are debters to the Church of Alexandria for this firſt inſtitution: where, in the dayes of <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Panthen,</hi> a man of great learning, firſt opened a Diuinitie ſchoole, by the authoritie of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Biſhop. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 5, hiſt. eccleſi. ca. 9.10.</note> (ſaith <hi>Euſebius</hi>) the cuſtome begun in the Church of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, was continued vnto vs: namely, to haue men that excelled in all knowledge and learning, to be Doctors, &amp; Diuinitie Readers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Panthen,</hi> a man ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie famous for his learning among the beſt learned in his time. After him came <hi>Origen,</hi> who tooke to him <hi>Heraclas</hi> the beſt of all his Schollers, theſe two parted the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Lectures between them. <hi>Origen</hi> read Diuinitie, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronimie, Geometrie, and Arithmatique, leauing the meaner Lectures of the Church of Alexandria to <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clas.</hi> The other Biſhops borrowed this commendable cuſtome of trayning vp of youth: this cuſtome ſpred ſo farre in this manner, that the Vniuerſities beginning to ſet learning abroach, the Biſhops became the firſt and laſt Iudges of theyr endeuours: and for this purpoſe haue they a Chauncelour ouer them, with whom the examination of this courſe, and theſe matters dooth reſide. As for Monkes, and religious perſons, they haue no authoritie to read Lectures but to their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>
               <p>I haue heeretofore related, what was the firſt and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Oeconomie of our Church, in Biſhops, Abbots, and Vniuerſities, vpon which three great Pillers our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſtands. Now let vs bring the Ieſuits to the touch, that we may know what they are. They be men appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled like our Prieſts, bearing no outward marke of Monks, yet do they make the three ſubſtantiall vowes of Chaſtitie Pouerty, and Obedience, common with other religious perſons, and they ioyne pouertie with it, as well
<pb facs="tcp:14558:62"/>in generall as particuler, by them of the laſt vow, which are called Fathers, men aboue others deuoted to preach, to adminiſter the holy ſacraments of Pennance, and of the Altar, to reade publique Lectures in all Sciences to all ſorts of ſchollers, without any ſubiection to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtatutes of the Vniuerſities: yea and without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of ſuperioritie of the Biſhops ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing their prerogatiue apart. But in concluſion, for the accompliſhment of their deuotion, they offer to goe into all quarters of the world, where it ſhall pleaſe the Pope to commaund them, to conuert Infidels and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, thereby to renewe in ſome ſort, the ancient practiſe of the Apoſtles. Therefore let vs now conſider, whether this innouation of theyrs, may by the auncient order of the Church, deſerue any place among vs, and whether they may be calld the companie of Ieſus; if not by priuation, at the leaſt by preuention of al other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>

               <p>As I was a ſleepe, me thought I ſaw GOD take a generall ſurueigh of his Church, from the paſſion of our ſauiour &amp; Redeemer Ieſus Chriſt, vnto this day: where (as it were) in a great proceſſion, the Apoſtles went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, followed by Popes, Patriarches, Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, Curates, prieſtes, and all thoſe Eccleſiaſticall perſons which are calld Seculars, becauſe they bee no Monks.

               <p>At the firſt, <hi>Ignace</hi> neuer doubted to be receiued of the Apoſtles, becauſe their preaching, adminiſtration of the ſacraments of Pennace &amp; of the Altar, and the great vowe of Miſſion made by the Fathers to the holie Sea, ſeemed to paue the way thether very faire for them; this made him ſteppe boldly to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> You ſhal be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the whole diſcourſe that paſſed between them.

Thus if there be any greater pride in the choice of the one, then of the other, it may eaſily be iudged from whence it comes. Moreouer, we doe not thinke, that the name of Chriſtian was impoſed vpon you by the Church of Antioch, but accidentally by the voice of the common people without iudgement, it was receiued to be by a ſecret inſpiratiation of God.</p>
               <p>At this ſpeech a great many ſaints and deuout men ſtanding in the firſt ranke, began to murmour ſoftly one to another, and ſome mutined out aloud: ſaying, that without giuing any further hearing vnto <hi>Ignace,</hi> he and all his followers were to be baniſhed our Church.
<pb facs="tcp:14558:64"/>And that by this propoſition, (the foundation of their order) there is much Iudaiſme, in Ieſuitiſme: for iuſt as the olde Iewes arraigned our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: ſo deale theſe new Iewes at this day with the Apoſtles.

And as the firſt Ieſus, was not the true Ieſus, but onely a figure of him: ſo the land of promiſe, was not the euerlaſting land of promiſe, but a figure of it.</p>
               <p>There was no Biſhop of note, nor any of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctors of the Church, in all the firſt ſquadron,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14558:64"/>which was not of this opinion, or brought not out ſome matter of attainder againſt <hi>Ignatius.</hi> Then Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> by his authority and primacy ouer all the Church, ſpake to them with an admirable Maieſtie on this manner. It is neither for you, nor for vs, to yeeld a reaſon of that which was done at Antioch, when the Church of God gaue the name of Chriſtians: this was a worke of the holy Ghoſt. And as it is not the ſeruants duty, to aske any reaſons of his Maiſter, why he commaunds him this or that, but he ought only to obey him: ſo God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing charged vs by his holy Spirit, to call our ſelues Chriſtians, it is not fit for any man whatſoeuer, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the cauſe of it. There is no ſpeedier way to make men heretiques, then to become curious queſtioniſts in ſuch matters. Therefore neuer thinke, that this name was impoſed vpon vs by the Suffrages of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people.</p>
               <p>As the name of Ieſus came from God the Father, ſo I may ſpeake it for a certaine truth, that by the faith and homage I yeelded to our Sauiour at the firſt, vpon this word Chriſt, he built his Church vpon me, and gaue me the Keyes thereof, among the reſt. For hauing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the queſtion of vs all, what men reported of him, ſome of the Diſciples aunſwered, that ſome tooke him to be Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt; others ſaid, hee was <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as:</hi> others one of the olde Prophets.<note place="margin">Math. 16. Luc. 8.</note> But whom doe you (quoth hee, to vs his Apoſtles) iudge me to bee? I, taking the tale out of the mouth of all the reſt of my fellowes, by the greatnes of zeale wherewith I was tranſported, aunſwered him, Thou art the Chriſt, the Sone of the liuing God: and preſently he replied, that I ſpeake not this of my ſelfe, but by Reuelation from God his father. And after this he declared me to be <hi>Peter,</hi> and that vpon this Rocke, he would build his Church, and whatſoeuer I bound on earth, ſhould be bound in heauen. Sith that vpon this confeſſion of Chriſt, he
<pb facs="tcp:14558:65"/>built his Church vpon me, this was a ſilent leſſon he taught vs of his will and pleaſure, that after his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into heauen, he would haue his Church to bee called Chriſtian; and vpon this proiect, all our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren doubted not to take vp that name at Antioch. I my ſelfe afterward, making <hi>Euodius</hi> Biſhop of that Sea,<note place="margin">Suidas in verb Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus.</note> confirmed that name of Chriſtian in the Church. I maruell ſaid Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> (turning himſelfe to <hi>Ignace</hi>) that you honouring, as you ſay ye doe, the Sea of Rome, where my ſucceſſours ſway the gouernment, and yet at the firſt daſh, you haue deſpiſed my decrees: were there nothing elſe but this to be weighed in you, you may not ſo be admitted into this ranke. <hi>Ign.</hi> Will you not receiue vs vpon the three vowes we haue with great holineſſe made, of Chaſtitie, Obedience, &amp; Pouertie; and that which is more, of generall and particular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, when we became fathers of our order? S. <hi>Peter</hi> This is another barre that ſhuts you out, for although Chaſtitie, Obedience, and Contempt of the world, were familiar matters with vs, yet did we not this by vow; that was brought into the Church after our time, by thoſe whom you ſee ſtand in the ſecond ranke, and to ſay the troth, wee neuer tyed our deuotion to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ign.</hi> Wee miniſter the Sacraments of pennance, and the communion as you did, and we are readie to go foorth for the aduauncement of Chriſtianitie, whither ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe your Succeſſours to ſend vs. S. <hi>Peter</hi> Theſe two Sacraments are likewiſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by the Mendicants, of which order there be many now in the Indies, in Paleſtine, and at Pera, neere vnto Conſtantinople, to conuert the Infidels, yet are they not ranged in our Squadron; you muſt go to them, and let them know, there is too great oddes betweene vs and you, to yeelde you anie place heere.</p>

                  <hi>Ignace,</hi> finding himſelfe excluded from the firſt ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this proceſſion, he was ſome-what amazed, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he thought to ſpeed better with the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould there haue to doe with <hi>S. Anthonie,</hi> the honour of all the firſt Hermits. For I know (quoth he) that in the heate of his holy meditations, hee gloried in ignorance: &amp; I am ſure, that if he doe but trie me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he ſhall find me nothing inferior vnto himſelfe. Thus deuiſing with himſelfe, what might beſt bee doone to creepe into his fauour, he ſhewed him, that he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his time in heauenly contemplations, and not in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as hee had done before. Yet true it was, that hys ignorance had made many learned men, which were all prieſted miniſtring the holy Sacraments; ſome of them were Preachers, and ſome Regents.</p>
               <p>The holy and venerable yeeres of this good Hermite, gaue <hi>Ignace</hi> this aunſwere: Brethren, I commend your intention, but it is nothing like vnto ours. Our deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the deuotion of all the good Fathers, firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the religious orders, was a ſolitarie life, without ſchollerſhip or prieſthood: our wiſedome conſiſts in continuall lifting vp the minde toward God, taking all humaine learning to be meere vanitie. And as for Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall functions, we take no charge of them, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the Biſhops, that feede vs by theyr inferiors in the Church. Your Rulers are not like ours.</p>
               <p>In Gods name my good brethren, goe your way in peace, leauing vs to our ſweet life, in quietnes of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, within our Cells. Neuertheleſſe, it may be you ſhall find behinde vs, ſome ſhreds and remnants of ours, in in whom you may take ſome roote, namely, thoſe which by permiſſion of the holy Sea, are called to the orders of prieſthood, and may both preach, and miniſter the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacraments of Penance and the Alter, as you doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignace</hi> paſſing from them to the other, Saint <hi>Benet</hi> perceiuing him comming by his gate, tooke the ſpeech
<pb facs="tcp:14558:66"/>to himſelfe, and ſaid; If you be of our companie, you muſt either be Ancors and Hermits, or Monks &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentualls. Your profeſſion, denies you to be Ancors, &amp; we may be eaſily entreated to excuſe you of it, becauſe that life is too painfull. But if you be Monks and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentualls, as we are, where is your frock, your hood, &amp; your cloake? For <hi>Elias,</hi> the firſt image of our Order, and after him <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, both differd from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people in apparrell. VVhere is the great ſhauen crowne vpon your heads, by which <hi>S.

Where be the Cloyſters within your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries? Heereto <hi>Ignace</hi> and his companions briefely and roundly anſwered him, that they were no Monkes, but religious perſons onely.</p>
               <p>Is it euen ſo, (ſaide <hi>S. Benet</hi>) then are you a kinde of quinteſſence of Monks. And as the facultie of Phiſicke admits none of theſe Paracelſian abſtractors of quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences into their ſchooles: ſo may not we receiue the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. To reiect a Paracelſite and a Ieſuite, both rime and reaſon will beare vs out. Therefore get you ſome whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther els: for as you diſdaine the holy name of Monks, ſo are you diſdained by Monkes. You proceeded Maiſters of Art in the Vniuerſitie of Paris, at the leaſt, you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented your ſelues for ſuch men to Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third, I counſell you to returne as Maiſters of Art to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, you ſhall finde ſome of your acquaintance there, it cannot be, but that ſome one or other of them wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignace</hi> perceiuing his caſe grow worſe and worſe, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted ſome misfortune in his attempts, whereuppon, turning himſelfe to his companions, he ſaid: Nowe we are in queſtion to goe toward the Vniuerſitie, I knowe what my behauiour muſt be; and although it will bee
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14558:66"/>eaſie for them to goe beforme me, if I come to the great Doctors, yet ſith at the firſt I tooke no courſe, but to teach pettie ſchooles for children, and you after me, haue read Lectures to all ſorts of ſchollers againſt our firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, I pray you (quoth he to Father <hi>Claudius Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiua,</hi>) ſeeing that now all my ſuperioritie ouer our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie reſts in you, that as Generall of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, you would take the charge to ſway Maiſter <hi>Iohn Gerſon,</hi> it may bee you ſhall find more fauour at his hands then all the reſt. <hi>Aquauiua,</hi> not onely gaue him no deniall, but thought his commaundement very fit to be obeyed.</p>
               <p>Then began hee and his to bragge, that they taught freely, wherein he thought his companie had very much aduantage of the other Regents, but his feete were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled: for he was more roughly handled by them then by the former, and when they came to pell mell, becauſe both ſides had beene nouſled in Schoole <hi>Ergoes,</hi> there was the beſt ſport of all. Nowe let vs ſee them beginne theyr diſputations. <hi>Aquauiua</hi> hauing framed his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and propounded his queſtion, <hi>Gerſon,</hi> one of the chiefeſt Doctors of Diuinitie that euer were in Fraunce, ſpake thus to <hi>Aquiuaua. Ger.</hi> You would faine be of our companie, will you then acknowledge our Biſhop, for your ſuperiour and ours, eſpecially in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inſtruction of youth: for hee is our chiefe Iudge in this cauſe. And now as his ſubſtitute in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Chauncellour, and Chanon of the Church of Paris, I cary the flagge of the Vniuerſitie of Paris, which is the chiefe of all others. <hi>Aqua.</hi> I doe not vnderſtand your ſpeech, we haue a greater Maiſter our holy Father the Pope, which hath diſpenced with vs in this point, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhops authoritie. <hi>Gerſ.</hi> You faile in the firſt marke, this one poynt muſt ſend you backe againe to Rome, to learne your leſſons, and baniſh you out of all the Vniuerſities in Fraunce. But let vs proceed: our Vniuerſities are compounded of two ſorts of men, the
<pb facs="tcp:14558:67"/>one are Seculars, the other Regulars, in either of theſe, the rule and gouernment differs. The Seculars may be Maiſters of Art, Doctors of diuinitie, Law, or Phiſicke, and read Lectures after they haue theyr degrees, to all commers, as well within as without the Colledges; the Regulars are permitted but to goe forth Doctors of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, and to reade to the nouices of their orders onely. Which of theſe two ſorts are you? Aunſwere mee not I beſeech you, as in the yeere 1564. you aunſwered the Rectors, and officers of our Vniuerſitie of Paris: they moouing the like queſtion to you, you replied twiſe or thriſe, that you were, <hi>Tales quales vos curia declarauerat.</hi> For the Aduocate that pleaded againſt you, ſtanding vpon this poynt, argued that you were ſuch as were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be enrolled in the Vniuerſities regiſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aqua.</hi> I maruell not at that, we were at that time like vnto the Beare, whoſe whelps ſeeme at the firſt to be but a rude lumpe of fleſh, but by the Dams continuall lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, in time they recouer the ſhape of a Beare: ſo was it once with vs; for (to tell you truth) <hi>Ignace</hi> and his companions, neuer prict it out perfectly what wee were; but after we had many wayes exerciſed our wits, vppon an obſcure platforme of theirs, we were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Monks, but regular Clarkes: for ſo hath our great <hi>Ribadmere</hi> entiteled vs;<note place="margin">Rib. lib. 2. capit. 17.</note> and before him, if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, the Counſell of Trent gaue vs the ſame ſtile, which was publiſht a fewe months after our cauſe vvas pleaded, to haue recourſe to the firſt day of May follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerſ.</hi> This is not to aunſwere my queſtion, you muſt aunſwere categorically, to bring you into one of theſe two predicaments, of Seculars, or Regulars. <hi>Aqua.</hi> Did I not aunſwere you at large, when I tolde you wee are Regular Clarks? For beeing ſuch, we are not bound to ſtand to the old ſtatutes of your Vniuerſities, beeing neither pure Seculars, nor pure Regulars. And we may
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14558:67"/>with all our vowes, be graduated throughout all your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and read publique lectures to youth in all ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without ſeeking to, or acknowledgement of, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of your Biſhops. <hi>Gerſ.</hi> Then are you a kind of Hermophroditicall order, ſuch as <hi>Paſquier</hi> hath publiſht you to be in his reſearches of Fraunce, for being Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and Regulars both together, you are neither of both. And ſith you are not bound to obey our ſtatutes, we likewiſe are not bound to immatriculate you in our V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſities. <hi>Aqua.</hi> Why do you refuſe vs, that teach freely? <hi>Gerſ.</hi> Becauſe you be verie coniecatchers. The firſt that euer came to teach in Paris, were <hi>Alcuin, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, Ian,</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> venerable <hi>Bedaes</hi> ſchollers, they made proclamation, that they had learning to ſell: you quite contrary, beſtow it gratis. Yet is it true, that in three ſcore yeeres ſpace, you haue got more treaſure twice or thrice told, then all the Vniuerſities in France euer had, ſince the firſt ſtone of their foundation was laid. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, were you not cenſured by the Vniuerſitie of Paris? in the yere 1554? <hi>Aqua.</hi> You may ſay what you wil, but of later memorie, the ſame facultie of Diuinitie, allowed vs againſt the old cenſure; for ſome particular perſons, hauing abuſed the name of the Vniuerſity of Paris in the yeere 1594. in the Court of Parliament; the Sorbons made a Decree in fauour of vs, by which the purſuit of our aduerſaries was diſalowed.</p>
               <p>At this ſpeech all the Sorbons ſhouted, you be lying Sophiſters, and verie bad Grammarians.

               <p>The ninth of Iuly, in the yeere of grace 1594. a view being taken by the faculty of Diuines in Paris, then law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſembled in the Sorbons great Hal, of a bil of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, put vp to the facultie, by the venerable fathers of the ſociety, wherein they declared, that a few moneths ſince, the Rector of the Vniuerſitie, as well in his owne name, as in the name of all the faculties, preferd a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the high Court of Parliament, wherein he required, that they, and all their ſocietie, might be thruſt out of Fraunce, and becauſe it was not credible that the moſt ſacred facultie had conſented to it, therfore they deſired the ſaid facultie, to teſtifie by ſome ſpeciall decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that they had no hand in this matter.

Away with the whole cluſter of new vowes, draw your ſelues into the Vniuerſities or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, acknowledge the Biſhop your ſuperiour, as we do, take degrees in Diuinitie onely, and read to none but to your owne Societie, as other religious do, euery one in their place: we ſhall then agree with you, and take your parts ſtoutly in the higheſt Courts in Fraunce, that you ought then to liue among vs. Meane while, by your writings, you doe impudently and falſely, make a Trophee of this Decree, as if wee had laid the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in your necks; but the verie ſight and reading of this, foyles you. Therefore get you packing, your Rules and Maxims impeach ours, which we of a long time haue kept in all holy and venerable anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Gerſon</hi> had pronounced this ſentence, <hi>Ignace</hi> and all his firſt companions vaniſht out of fight, and preſently after that, <hi>Aquauiua</hi> ſpying himſelfe and thoſe that were with him, left in the lurch, he cried.

<pb facs="tcp:14558:69"/>deceiued: For this company of wilde youths baited him worſe then they did before. <hi>Gerſon</hi> to pacifie them, ſaid, My ſonnes, neuer thinke that in Rome they will haue ſo little wit as to make theſe two men Saints. The Ieſuits haue deſired it a long time, and to compaſſe it, they haue imployed not their coyne (for I thinke there is no ſuch trafick in Rome about ſanctifying of ſoules) but all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of lies, cogs, &amp; hypocriſies, to ſurprize the holy Sea. For how comes it to paſſe thinke you, that within theſe few yeeres, the pens of <hi>Maffee, Ribadiner</hi> and <hi>Turcelline,</hi> haue hatched ſo many fabulous viſions, &amp; miraculous tales of <hi>Xauier,</hi> but to make their falſe teſtimonies ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable for this canonization? But the beſt ſport I ſee, that as plaiers, to grace their Enterluds, bring them vpon the ſtage by day, with the windowes ſhut, and candles lighted; So the Ieſuits ſpare for no burning Tapers in Rome, about <hi>Iguace</hi> Tombe, to make ſome better ſhew of the ſanctimonie of the place.<note place="margin">Turcel. lib. 1 ca. 16.</note> And the ſame <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelline</hi> ſaith, that when <hi>Xauiers</hi> bodie was carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Towne of <hi>Gonea,</hi> where it now lieth, there was a great waxe Candle onely of a Cubite length, ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſet in the place, which burned continually two and twentie dayes, and as manie nights without waſting.</p>
               <p>Yet haue not all theſe Torches, to this day beene able, to lighten the hearts of the Conſiſtory of Rome, to make theſe two new Saintes, neyther will they euer doe it, as I am perſwaded. Neuer thinke ſo Sir, ſaid a little wagge in the companie, for lyes, and importunate ſuits, (matters proper to the Ieſuits) will worke it out at laſt. Haue you forgot in <hi>Boccace,</hi> how <hi>Chappellet de Prat,</hi> a notable knaue, was canonized for a Saint, by ſome ſilly ſoules in the Cordeliers Monaſterie at Dijon? And why may it not ſo fall out with <hi>Ignace Loyola,</hi> founder of the Ieſuits order, ſeeing <hi>William du Prat,</hi> Biſhop of Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont was their firſt benefactor here in Fraunce?</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:14558:69"/>
               <p>Preſently vppon this ſpeech they made ſuch a noyſe, that if it had thundred, you would ſcarce haue heard it. Continuing this hurly burly, ſome of the beſt Schollers began to clap their hands, as they doe in the Schooles, when the one ſide and the other haue argued long, and diſputation ceaſeth.</p>
               <p>With this I waked, very much aſtonied at this dreame, wherein I find that verified, which one <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi> ſpake, in the beginning of his <hi>Romant</hi> of the <hi>Roſe,</hi> ſaying, that euery dreame is not falſe. My dreame doth make it good: I know what account the Ieſuits doe, and ought to make of the counſell of Trent, as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the approbation of theyr ſocietie is partly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Although they haue expreſly commaunded all Clergie men, as well Seculars as Regulars, to goe the proceſſions, except the cloſe Monks, Carthuſians, and Celeſtines. Neuertheleſſe, the Ieſuits neuer came there, eyther before that Counſell was held, or after. It is verie true that they coggd a Die, when they got a Bull from Gregorie the 13. to forbid them this matter: But thys was before their conſtitutions bare anie prohibition.</p>
               <p>I come nowe to another matter, which is, that <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Roſſell,</hi> one of <hi>Ignace</hi> fauourers,<note place="margin">Rib. lib. 3. cap. 14. Maf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The religious men of Saint <hi>Benits</hi> order, <hi>S. Barnards, S. Dominicks,</hi> and <hi>S. Fraunces,</hi> do all weare the habite appertaining to their orders. The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits are apparrelled as prieſts, if women ſhould haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that attire to, you muſt haue called them vvomen prieſts.</p>
               <p>Let vs returne to our proceſſions, which all good and free Catholiques religiouſly embrace, <hi>Ignace</hi> bragged euery where he was a Catholique, why then did he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb facs="tcp:14558:70"/>his ſocietie the proceſſions? Becauſe hee knew, that if they came among other Eccleſiaſticall orders, they were vncertaine what place they ſhould take, theyr ſect being a newe baſtard religion, a very hotch potch of all our orders, without any thing pure in it, or any poynt of our auncient Church. Therefore, to call them the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Ieſus, is to goe out of the way, but I wil now giue them a name more agreeable vnto them. I remember I haue read in the <hi>Romante</hi> of the <hi>Roſe,</hi> late alledged by me, that when Saint <hi>Lewes</hi> brought the Carmelites into Fraunce, from Mount Carmell, they vvere called the Pred-coats, becauſe their cloakes were ſtriped &amp; welted with black &amp; white. Sith then we ſee the Ieſuits to be a partie-colourd religion, of diuers peeces of our ancient Church, ill ſuted &amp; ſowed together, you may call them and theyr religion, the new Motley.</p>
               <p>Heere the Aduocate held his peace, which miniſtred matter of talke vnto the Gentleman, who ſaid to him, I know not how true it is, that you had ſuch a dreame as you haue told me, yet I may well ſay, there is much truth in it. And more then that, you cannot paynt out theſe matters more liuely, then by the picture of a dreame. But ſeeing you make reckoning of the <hi>Romant</hi> of the <hi>Roſe,</hi> me thinks by the modell of it, wee may more fitlie call the Ieſuits, Papelards, and theyr companie, Pape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardie. Heere-vnto ſaide the Aduocate, I beſeech you let vs not ingage the authoritie of the holie Sea, by the quarrell of theſe hypocrits. I will not, ſaide the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſith you haue bound mee to harken till you haue made an end.</p>

This fleſht <hi>Peter Ribadiner,</hi> another prieſt of the ſame ſocietie, to make a reflection vppon his fellow, with fiue other bookes, ten yeeres after; wherein, at the firſt ſetting out, hee endeuours to make his hiſtorie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be without check, becauſe that before the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of their company, he, beeing not yet 14. yeeres of age, followed <hi>Ignace</hi> at Rome, ſo throughly deuoted to him, that he brags he could ſpeake of many things he ſawe himſelfe, and faithfully reckon vp others, vvhich <hi>Lewes Gonſalua,</hi> a man to whom <hi>Ignace</hi> diſcourſed them at large a yeere before, had reported to him.

               <p>I will rip vp heere, the moſt famous viſions, which they ſay theyr great Sophy had. <hi>Ignace,</hi> by theyr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, deſcended of the noble houſe of <hi>Loyhola,</hi> was in his tender yeeres, ſent by his Father &amp; Mother to the Court of King <hi>Fardinand,</hi> ſurnamed the Catholique, &amp; in the yeere 1522. put in truſt to keepe the towne of Pampelune, then beſieged by the French, where one of his legs was ſhiuerd with a ſhot, and the other verie ſore hurt: the towne deliuered, and hee taken priſoner, our Nation ſent him away with much kindneſſe to his owne houſe.

And when hee was recouered, ſpending his time in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding amorous diſcourſes, becauſe he could get no other bookes, one gaue him the life of our ſauior Ieſus Chriſt, and the Legend of the Saints, which he read; and from that time grew admirable deuout deſirous to change his old life, into a more auſtere &amp; religious courſe: where-vpon, the virgine <hi>Mary</hi> appeared to him night by night, with a ſmiling countenaunce, holding her little babe in her armes: vpon this viſion, hee forſooke the world for euer after.

               <p>To make vs way to Paradice, we paſſe through the Sacrament of Baptiſme, &amp; when our Sauiour was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, at his comming out of the water, he ſaw the heauens open, and the holy Ghoſt deſcending in the ſhape of a Doue, and reſting vpon his head, and therewithall, a voice was heard, Thou art my deere ſonne in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am well pleaſed. When <hi>Ignace</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed to open a way to his company, he ſaw God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; Ieſus Chriſt his ſon, who ſaid to him, Go in peace, for I wil take thy part in the citie of Rome. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was repreſented by the ſhape of a bird, it was inough: but me thinks it is more, that <hi>Ignace</hi> ſaw God the Father, and God the Son alſo, in his proper body. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was tempted but once, one maner of way by
<pb facs="tcp:14558:74"/>the diuel: <hi>Ignace</hi> twice tempted diuerſly, &amp; by very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſiue ſpeech. Ieſus Chriſt faſted fortie daies in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes without meat or drink: <hi>Ignace</hi> faſted only ſeuen daies, &amp; to counterpoize the reſt of Chriſts faſting, he diſciplind himſelf thrice a day, &amp; ſpent ſeuen houres of the day vpon his knees in praier. The man whom our Sauiour ſingled out for a choſen veſſel to himſelfe, was S. <hi>Paule:</hi> when he wrought his conuerſion, he appeared not to him, but aſſaulted him only with ſharpe ſpeeches, <hi>Saul, Saul,</hi> why doſt thou perſecute me? and he was three daies blind, &amp; did neither eate nor drink. This miracle is nothing in compariſon of <hi>Ignace,</hi> whoſe ſoule was caried into heauen, where he ſaw the Trinitie in three perſons, and one eſſence: and after that, was in a traunce ſeuen whole daies together, without ſight, meat, or drinke. Beſide all this, he had one thing in particular ſhewed to him (beyond all that is ſpoken of in the olde Teſtament) he ſaw the tooles God himſelfe occupied when he faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned &amp; fitted this great frame of the world: A bleſſing neuer beſtowed vpon any man, but <hi>Ignace.</hi> All we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the tranſubſtantiation of the body and bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Alter: a matter we cannot ſee with bodily eies, but by the eies of faith. <hi>Ignace</hi> herein paſſed vs all, when at the eleuation of the hoſt, he ſaw Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt there, God &amp; man. I leaue the ſhaking of the houſe where he was, by an earth quake, like vnto that of <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Silas.</hi> I omit many other viſions, ſpecified by me heretoſore; and credit me, when I had read ouer <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badiner,</hi> I found nothing in his ſir-name and his booke, but baldarie. And as for <hi>Maffee,</hi> I thinke he is transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into <hi>Morpheus,</hi> which preſents ſundry ſhadowes to men a ſleepe.</p>
               <p>I doubt not, but that God was able to worke all theſe miracles by <hi>Ignace,</hi> and much greater to, if it had ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee him: he is the ſame God now that he was in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles daies: God without beginning, and without
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14558:74"/>end: but that he hath done any ſuch thing, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and auouch theſe to be blaſphemous impoſtures, dropt by the Druell himſelfe out of the pennes of two Ieſuits, to ſnare ſimple people with their curſed ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. I will make this matter cleare and euident. The moſt pregnant proofes of all are thoſe, which we call preſumptions of law and of fact, which ariſe out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie particularities, when they meet together, and when they do not agree with them, this is to deceiue, againſt the common ſence and vnderſtanding of the people. The greateſt iudgement that euer was giuen, was that of <hi>Salomen,</hi> betweene the true and the ſuppoſed mother, for which hee was called <hi>Salomon</hi> the wiſe, yet was this grounded vpon preſumption. For my part, I thinke I haue greater preſumptious than that <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had, to proue, that the pretended viſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with theſe two hypocrites bleare your eyes, are miſts and illuſions.</p>
               <p>I will make this matter manifeſt, and omit the ſcruple tucht by me before, that the writers hereof be Ieſuits: no, this is not the point whereupon I meane to reſt. I could be content to tell you, that I make no reckoning of <hi>Maffee.</hi> He hath written ſo, therefore it is true, I denie it; &amp; deſire to be enformed who told it him: and I will ſhew you my reaſon hereafter. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the hiſtorie, I build more vpon <hi>Ribadiner,</hi> who ſaith he was in his young yeeres in <hi>Ignace</hi> company at Rome, and that whatſoeuer he reports: he heard it of <hi>Lewes Gonſalua,</hi> to whom <hi>Ignace</hi> imparted it a yeere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died.</p>
               <p>Therefore this honeſt man the Ieſuit, might well ſpeake of all thoſe things which <hi>Ignace</hi> did at Rome, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was choſen Generall of their order, and of that which fell out before. I ſhould be a ſcrupulous gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer, if I ſhould ſay, that you may not beleeue <hi>Ribadiner,</hi> when he tels you, <hi>Gonſalua</hi> ſpak it: neither is <hi>Gonſalua,</hi> if
<pb facs="tcp:14558:75"/>he were aliue, any Saint, but ſuch as for whom we keepe no holy-day, although he auouch he heard all theſe tales of <hi>Loyola.</hi> I will tread all theſe matters vnder foot, I do beleeue that <hi>Ribadiner</hi> heard it of <hi>Gonſalua,</hi> and <hi>Gonſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> receiued the newes of all theſe miracles from <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.</hi> Let vs now giue credit to <hi>Ignace</hi> in his own cauſe, for none but he can ſay, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> appeard to him firſt, and then the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> that he was two ſeuerall times viſibly tempted of the diuell: that he ſaw the Trinitie in heauen, Chriſt Ieſus in fleſh and bodie in the hoſt, the ſoule of <hi>Hozius</hi> his companion caried to heauen, that God ſhewed him how he made the world, that Chriſt promiſed him to aſſiſt him in Rome: all this reſts vpon <hi>Ignace</hi> onely, none but he can giue vs teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it, and this makes me ſay, that if we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, we were verie heauie headed.</p>
               <p>If I were to reſt vpon this point, I ſhould haue inough to prooue you ought neither to receiue nor reiect all theſe miracles, but I will proceed. When <hi>I aſquier</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cauſe, one of the faireſt parts of it was that, with which he ſtoutly chalenged the Ieſuits, to choake him with any one miracle that euer <hi>Ignace</hi> wrought: he ſaid, that all the holy Fathers, Saint <hi>Benet,</hi> Saint <hi>Dominic,</hi> Saint <hi>Frances,</hi> and others, confirmed their new orders by many miracles done by them, as we read in their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends: but not any one could be found done by <hi>Ignace.</hi> I haue deliuerd you that paſſage, word for word, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſpake of <hi>Poſtles</hi> impiety. <hi>Ignace</hi> was dead eight yeeres before this was pleaded. After his death, all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred towards him ceaſed, when men talked of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; for we cannot ſpeake ſo freely of the liuing. This cauſe was prolonged ſeuen moneths and more, both in the Vniuerſity of Paris, and in the Court of Parliament, when they ſtood vpon the maine making or marring of their order. <hi>Iames Laniez,</hi> companion &amp; ſucceſſor of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> in his generalſhip, either knew theſe things, or ought
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14558:75"/>to know them, and leaſure and time inough had he to certifie. Neuertheleſſe, in all <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſoris</hi> Plea, there is not one word ſpoken of viſions or miracles. A ſigne, that theſe lies, were new coyned by theſe Papelards after the cauſe was pleaded. Put this to it, that all the viſions <hi>Maf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee</hi> and <hi>Ribadiner</hi> reckon vp, hapned in Spaine, before <hi>Ignace</hi> either had the Popes bleſſing, or his order was allowed. And that after hee was choſen Generall, you ſhall not find in theſe two Ieſuiticall Prieſts, any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhewed him from heauen, nor any miracle done while he liued, nor after his death: yet if any miracle came from him, of force it muſt be either then when the holy Sea confirmed him, or after. In Rome, you ſee <hi>Ignace</hi> his forecaſt was good,<note place="margin">Turſ. lib. 5. ca. 16.</note> to bring a new ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie into our old religion, but no marke of miracles at all. And why thinke you? becauſe all his viſions hapned to him in Spaine, two of them onely excepted, which he had in Italie, in corners: but neither durſt he, nor his miniſters, broach ſo groſſe matters in Rome. I ſpeake expreſly of Rome, where,</p>

               <p>Will you haue me lay this impoſture open to your eies, by ſome other iſſuing from the ſame root? Among the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions or diſciples of <hi>Ignace,</hi> there was one <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Xauier,</hi> appointed by him to go to the Indies at the requeſt of King <hi>Iohn</hi> of Portugall. <hi>Ribadiner</hi> wrote his hiſtorie, onely vpon report of the countrie, as the farther a Ieſuit goes, the louder he lies: ſo <hi>Horace Turſellin,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming after the reſt, reflects vpon his companion, with great increaſe and intereſt. For neuer did our Sauiour Chriſt while he was vpon the earth, nor after his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> not Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> worke ſo great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as <hi>Xauier</hi> did in the Indies. He was a Prophet that foretold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things to com, he did read means thoughts,<note place="margin">Turſ. lib. 6. ca. 1. Turſ. lib. 2. cap. 18.</note> he made the crooked to go vpright, the dumb to ſpeake, the deafe to heare, he cured the leapers, he rid the ſicke
<pb facs="tcp:14558:76"/>of their diſeaſes when the Phiſitians had giuen them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: ſaying but a Creed, or a Goſpel ouer men, he had a facultie to raiſe the dead. For in the ſeuenth Chapter of his ſecond booke, he finds, that he had raiſed ſix: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, vpon his returne from Iappon, ſpying one of his companions laid out vpon the Bere, and ready to be put into the ground, he reſtored him to life againe, as he had done a Pagans daughter.<note place="margin">Turſ. lib. 4. cap. 3.</note> But the grace of the tale is, that ſhe returning on foot, knew <hi>Xauier,</hi> and told her father, this was the man, that had puld her ſoule backe againe out of hell. And that which was neuer heard of before in our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Turſ. lib. 4. cap. 7. &amp; lib. 5. cap. 7.</note> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted many people by Mediators and Interpretors. Likewiſe, he wrought many miracles by the miniſterie of others, namely, by ſuch as ſcarce had any knowledge of our Church. For after he had Baptized and Catechized little infants,<note place="margin">Turſ. lib. 2. ca. 7.</note> he gaue them his beads, wherewith the ficke being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, they recouered health. Being at Meliopora, there was a rich Citizen poſſeſſed with many diuels, <hi>Xauier</hi> was intreated to go to him, but hauing other buſines, he ſent a little child to him with a croſſe, which being laid vpon the poſſeſſed, and a Goſpel ſaid ouer him, in ſuch manner as <hi>Xauier</hi> had commaunded, preſently all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels were caſt out, very much angred, that they were eiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch a one as was yet but a nouice in Chriſtianity. <hi>Hoc magis indignantes</hi> (ſaith the author) <hi>quod per puerum pellebantur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 2. ca. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; eum Neophylum.</hi> Another time it fell out ſo, that being requeſted to helpe one that was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe he could not goe himſelfe in perſon, he put ſome little children in commiſſion, teaching them their leſſon what they ſhould do, and putting a croſſe in their hands. Theſe came to the poſſeſſed, whom they made to kiſſe the Croſſe, according to their direction, ſaying certaine prayers ouer him, vvhich they had learned by heart, and preſently, as well by the faith of theſe little brats, as by <hi>Xauiers,</hi> the diuell went out of the man, but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14558:76"/>he was reuenged on him at the laſt: For when <hi>Xauier</hi> was vpon his knees before the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> the diuell ſo ſcracht him by the backe, &amp; belly, that the poore man had none to flie vnto but the Virgin, crying vnto her: <hi>Domina opitulare, Domina non opitulaberis?</hi> And after this, was conſtraind to keepe his bedde vntil his skinne was healed.</p>
               <p>I omit a great many particulars, that I may come to other of <hi>Xauiers</hi> miracles, as well in his life as in his death: for departing this life at <hi>Siues,</hi> his bodie was rold vp in quicke lime, that beeing ſpeedily conſumed, it might not putrifie: neuertheleſſe, being ſixe moneths after caried to the Towne of Goa, where he lieth, hee was found to looke as freſh and ſound, as when he liued.<note place="margin">Lib. 5. ca. 12.</note> After he was brought to this Towne, there was a waxe Candle of a cubit long, placed at the foote of his Tombe, which burnt two and twentie daies, and as many nights, and was not waſted. A man that neuer ſaw further then the length of his owne noſe, hauing got ſo much fauour of the Prieſts, as to open him <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiers</hi> Tombe, tooke the dead mans hand and rubbed his eies with it, and preſently recouered his ſight.<note place="margin">Lib. 5. ca. 4.</note> Many other miracles were done by his dead corps: But I find none ſo famous as theſe two: for one of his Diſciples, hauing ſtollen away the whip wherewith he beat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and a woman called <hi>Marie Sarra</hi> did cut of a peece of his girdle, which ſhe wrought into ſiluer, and wore it about her necke, theſe two deuout perſons, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an infinite number of all ſorts of diſeaſes, by the bare touch of theſe two reliques.</p>
               <p>All theſe miracles were done in the Indies, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other moe if you beleeue <hi>Turſellin.</hi> After the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their order, <hi>Xauier</hi> was not to be compared in ſanctitie with <hi>Ignace,</hi> his Superiour and firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that ſocietie being inſpired with the holy Ghoſt, although not in ſo great meaſure as the Apoſtles were,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:77"/>(ſaith the wiſedome of <hi>Fon.</hi>) And all viſions ceaſed in him, that day that his order was allowed, and he ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Rome; but contrariwiſe, they budded a freſh in <hi>Xauier:</hi> what cauſeth this difference? I will tell you: If <hi>Ignace</hi> had ſet downe his ſtaffe in the Indies, and <hi>Xauier</hi> abode in Rome, <hi>Ignace</hi> had wrought many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and <hi>Xauier</hi> none, for in theſe caſes, it is a great deale better cheape to beleeue them, then to trauell from place to place, to enquire whether they be true or no.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſtories, are in verie deed ſuch, as by common prouerbe we call old wiues fables, that is to ſay, fit to be told to ſimple women, when they ſit ſpinning by the fire ſide. One <hi>Iustinian,</hi> a Ieſuit in Rome, called Father <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> counterfeited himſelfe to be leaprous, to make his cure miraculous: Againe, he would haue made men beleeue, that being ſhot with a Piſtoll through his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the bullet rebounded backe againe from his body, without hurt, and ſo by the wonderful grace of God, he was not wounded. Theſe matters were beleeued by the ſimple people at the firſt, but after they were found to be falſe, this marred the whole roaſt of the Ieſuits cookerie in Rome, for when they did ſpeake of a facer out of matters, and an Impoſter, they were woont to call him, a ſecond <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Ieſuit.</p>
               <p>It may be you will iudge it ſtraunge. I tell you, we need not looke into Spaine, nor the Indies for their forgeries, ſith of late yeeres they bruted it abroad in Fraunce, that <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> was dead, and that at his death, he was conuerted to our Catholique Apoſtolique Romane Religion, by one of their companie: by whoſe example, many Citizens of Geneua had done the like, through the trauels of the Ieſuits. We tooke it to be true a while, but after that <hi>Beza</hi> was knowne to be riſen againe, hee wrote certaine French and Latine Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by which he conuinced their impudencie. What a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14558:77"/>mint of fables will they haue in ſtrange countries, which euen in the midſt of vs, feare not to feede vs with ſuch bables?</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, to make the matter plaine, what notable lyers <hi>Maffee</hi> and <hi>Ribadiner</hi> are, (for as I begunne with them, ſo will I end,) <hi>Ribadiner</hi> ſhewes vs one <hi>Ignace</hi> in Spaine, who all vppon the ſuddaine hauing abandoned the world, <hi>caeſariem elegantem habebat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rib. lib. 1. capit. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>ſolutam et impexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reliquit, vngues et barbam excreſcere ſunt.</hi> He had a fayre head of haire, which he layd out looſe &amp; vnkempt, fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the wind; he neither cut his beard, nor pared his nayles. Looke vpon his picture in the beginning of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badiners</hi> booke, there is nothing ſo ſlick as hee, neyther his locks, nor his beard, nor his nailes growne. You may imagin by this, what is in the reſt of al theyr bookes. And to ſay the truth, when I ſee <hi>Maffee, Ribadiner,</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celline,</hi> beſtow ſo good Latine vpon ſuch lying matter, it makes me remember our old <hi>Romants,</hi> of <hi>Piers Forrest, Lancelot Dulac, Tristram</hi> of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and other aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Knights of the Round-table, which had all ſtrooke hands in amitie, and ſworne reciprocally on to another: in honour of whom, many gallant pennes haue been ſet a work to make idle tales, in as good French as that time afforded. In like manner haue theſe three Ieſuits writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not a hiſtorie, but a <hi>Romant</hi> full of fables, touching the life of <hi>Ignace</hi> &amp; his fellowes, all wandering Knights of the trauailing Robe, linked together in a band of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble ſocietie; it is fit that euery thing ſhould haue his turne.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Aduocate had ended his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the Gentleman ſaid to him. You may iudge what you will of thoſe two that haue written the life of <hi>Ignace,</hi> if you can perſwade me, that our age neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a brauer man, nor more fit to make a new ſect then he, I will take no exceptions to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maell</hi> the Perſian Sophie. When I ſpeake of a ſect, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you my Maiſters be not you offended: for I take the word in his natiue ſignification, for ſuch a forme of life and diſcipline, as in old time was attributed to the Philoſophers. I ſee three men combined by the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our time, <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> a Germane, <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> a French man, and <hi>Ignace de Loyola,</hi> a Spaniard, all three great men, I will not ſpeake of the doctrine of the two former, which I condemne; yet neither was <hi>Luther</hi> nor <hi>Caluin,</hi> ſo great as <hi>Loyola.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, made an vproare in all Germanie: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, ſo troubled Fraunce, that there was no ſafety for him but in Geneua: &amp; the laſt, hath made a pudder, not onely in Spaine, and the prouinces depending vpon that Kingdome, but in many other Nations alſo. And that which is more admirable, the two former, got their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with their pen, and the laſt, by writing nothing. For as you your ſelfe haue truly diſcourſed, <hi>Ignace</hi> was aboue thirty yeeres of age before hee learned his Accedence. Long before this time, he compiled three books in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, one of them was intituled, <hi>Spirituall exerciſes:</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was of the Trinitie, and the third, was of the life of Ieſus Chriſt, the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> and ſome of the Saints: neuertheleſſe, hee did wiſely to ſtop the breath of thoſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14558:78"/>bookes againe betimes, hee knewe well the weakenes of the ſtile, and with what broken timber they were built. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> were brought vp, the one in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, the other in Colledges, where they began to puſh at the chiefe Gouernours of the Church of Rome, and ſcholler-like ſpent their time, in contentious wits and writers. <hi>Loyola,</hi> borne of a noble familie, in his youth trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp in a great Kings court, drew his buſines to a head very Gentleman-like. For beeing deſirous to continue the newe tyrannie which he had plotted, in ſted of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which happily might be confuted, he drew all out of heauen, that no body might ſpeake againſt it.</p>
               <p>Doe not you remember, that <hi>Minos</hi> King of Creete, going about to make new lawes to his ſubiects, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them that he had conferd with <hi>Iupiter: Lycurgus</hi> in Sparta, with <hi>Apollo: Numa Pompilius</hi> in Rome, with the Nymph <hi>Aegeria:</hi> and <hi>Sertorius,</hi> to purchaſe the more authoritie with his ſouldiours, ſaid he was familiar with a Doe, as if one of theyr imaginarie Gods had beene transformed into her. Theſe are the Machiauelliſmes of which the old world was deliuered before <hi>Machiauell</hi> was borne. And there be a great many <hi>Machiauells</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs at this day, who neuer read his bookes; I think the ſame deuiſes glided through the ſoule of this great <hi>Ignace,</hi> &amp; I aſſure my ſelfe, that hee reckned vp to <hi>Lewes Gonſalua</hi> before he died, (for ſo <hi>Ribadiner</hi> tell vs) all his viſions of God, of the virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, promiſing him all the helpe he could to further him at Rome; whereby hee grew in hope that in time to come, all the Generals his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, ſhould become the higheſt Commaunders.</p>
               <p>And that which makes mee wonder more, is a matter I will now acquaint you with. We read, that when <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> had lockt himſelfe faſt into the ſaddle of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, yet tenne yeeres after, to auoyd all enuie, he counterfeited before the Senate, that he would giue

               <p>
                  <hi>Ignace</hi> had the like conceit of his Generalſhip: for when he had gouernd tenne yeeres, or there about, with abſolute authoritie, hee called together the greateſt part of the Fathers the Ieſuits at Rome, and before the whole aſſembly, deſired them to diſpence with him in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment heereafter, becauſe the charge was too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie for his ſhoulders: But they with all meekeneſſe, commending his modeſtie, denied him his requeſt, as a matter very preiudiciall to theyr Order. And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they entrated him to take care of theyr conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Rib. lib. 4. capit. 2.</note> to augment, or diminiſh, or qualifie them as hee thought good. From that day, he tooke the reines into his hand, to commaund them in ſuch maner as you ſee: but hee would not haue his ſtatuts publiſht, before they were confirmed by a generall meeting. Meane while, he left a writing in a little coffer, in manner of a Iournall, how things paſſed betweene the holy Ghoſt and him, and the viſions ſet downe, where-with hee was inſpired when he made his conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>Theſe remembrances were found after his death, and with great wonderment preſented to the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation held at Rome, in the yeere 1558. where all that he had ordred was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered of, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the hands of theyr Printers and Stationers. You blame <hi>Ignace</hi> in your diſcourſe, for all his appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; you ſay they were impoſtures contriued by him, vpon which ground his ſocietie hath coyned manie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Pardon mee, I pray you, for you iudge of theſe matters like a Punie, not like a Stateſman. I tell you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14558:79"/>I doubt not but that <hi>Ignace</hi> hath told you all his viſions, whereof he himſelfe alone was witneſſe. But when? Not in the flower of his age, when he was in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when ſicknes and age had broken him, and he ſaw himſelfe at the graues brinke; perſwading himſelfe, there could be no better meane to eſtabliſh his order af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, and confirme his ſtatutes, then to feede them, not with theſe holy, but rather fained illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he oppoſed without printing of Bookes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn Caluins</hi> vaine diſputes and <hi>Ergoes.</hi> Was there euer playd a brauer, a wiſer, and a bolder pranke then this?</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Gentleman had ſcarce ended his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but the Aduocate anſwered. You and I will enter the Liſt together to fight it out. For all that <hi>Maffee</hi> and <hi>Ribadiner</hi> haue written of <hi>Ignace,</hi> is falſe, &amp; all that you haue ſaid is true. That which I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hetherto, is by way of an introduction to the ſport, I am determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſhew you now what theyr vowes be, which I will proue to be ſtuffed with erronious and hereticall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and an infinite mingle mangle of Machiauelliſmes and Anabaptiſtries, vvhich time hath meaſht toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Aduocate prepared himſelfe to goe forward, not remembring that it was high mid-night, then ſaid the Gentleman: If you haue any ſuch purpoſe, it is beſt to deferre it vntill to morrow morning, the night is farre ſpent, and you my Maiſters (my new gueſts) are wearied with your iourney, &amp; you in particular my good friend, (quoth he to the Aduocate) are tired with talking, and we with hearing. I areſt you all, you are nowe my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:80"/>and thinke not that I will let you go to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: let vs take a little truce with our eyes, our tongues, our eares, and our thoughts, me thinks this diſcourſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues to be proſecuted with a faſting wit: it were fit, it ſhould not be taken vpon a ſudden, but that you ſhould pauſe vpon this which is already ſpoken, if ſleep will ſuffer you. Neuer yet was good Aduocate, how well ſoeuer he were prouided for a great cauſe, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to haue put it off to another day, that he might be better furniſht: and I think you neuer ſpake to a matter of more importance then this.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemans aduice was taken, and euerie man retyred him into his chamber, vntill ſeuen of the clocke in the morning, then euerie one hauing been at Church to render vnto God, not what euerie man is bound, but what euerie man was able to performe: the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie met in the Hal. The Gentleman gaue his ſeruants ſtraight commaundement, that none of them ſhould be ſo hardie as to interrupt them, whatſoeuer buſines fell out. Now let vs go on with our tale (quoth he) for we cannot doe a better deed then this: but vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that in our ſpeech, we raile vpon no bodie. We may not eaſily be drawen to perſecute ſo harmeleſſe a companie, as many men take the Ieſuits to be.</p>
               <p>The Aduocate promiſed to deale honeſtly herein, proteſting againe that he would not ſpeake for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grudge he bare them, but for the common good of all men. And to make it ſo appeare to you (quoth he) I leaue all affectation, and flowers of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique, wherewith men of my profeſſion vſe to grace their ſpeech. I will read thoſe paſſages plainely to you, vpon which, all that I intend to doe, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and if anie man will put any better ſtuffe to it when I haue done, I giue him leaue. For the beſt Art I obſerue, is to ſhew no Art at all. But ſith the Ieſuits do now ſue for a re-eſtabliſhment of them in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14558:80"/>Fraunce, I will begin with that, that toucheth vs neereſt. The Aduocate hauing in one of his Portmantewes all the Buls, and conſtitutions, that concerne the Ieſuits, and many other bookes of like argument, as well with them, as againſt them, he laid them forth vpon a greene Carpet, thus as he had done the night before, ſo procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he now to verifie his ſpeech.

               <p>Good God: Can we abide this order in our countrey of Fraunce?

               <p>If theſe two Articles take place, there is no Prince, be he what he will, that can be aſſured in his eſtate. And I pray you ſuppoſe, that this confeſſionary was printed in the yeere 1589. that is to ſay, to confirme &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize, that which was purpoſed againſt the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, in the beginning of the yeere, when certaine ill diſpoſed perſons would haue declared him to be a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p n="51">51. We haue in this countrey of Fraunce, an appeale, as it were a writ of Errour, of the thundring of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike Buls; when they are found to enterprize anie thing, eyther againſt the maieſtie of our Kings, or againſt the auncient Councels, receiued and approued in our Church of Fraunce, or againſt the liberties thereof, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the authoritie Royall, or Acts of the high Courts. This appeale as from the abuſe, I tell you, is one of the principall ſinewes of the maintenance of our eſtate.</p>
               <p>The Ieſuit will not acknowledge it, for many cauſes, which touch him neere, which I will not here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer.</p>
               <p n="52">52 The Ieſuits acknowledge none for their Iudge, but the Pope, or their General, deſiring by this means, to fend vs backe againe to that old labyrinth of Rome, wherof our good Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> complaind to Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> in his bookes of conſolation. And thereof we ſaw a notable example in Burdeaux, when <hi>Lager,</hi> Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Colledge of the Ieſuits, declared that he would not obey the Maire and Iurats, who had ſent for him for the preuenting of a certaine ſedition: ſaying, that he acknowledged: them for ciuil Magiſtrates ouer the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of the Citie, but that neither they, nor any other Iudges, of what nation, qualitie, dignitie, and authority ſoeuer, had any power ouer their ſocietie, but onely our holy Father the Pope, or the Generall of their order. And ſhall we then ſuffer this family to liue in the midſt of vs? That were indeed to receiue in a vermine, which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14558:86"/>at length will gnaw out the heart of our eſtate, both ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14558:87"/>the leaſt, you cannot deny, that we are aſſiſted with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of the Buls of diuers Popes, <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth and fifth, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thriteenth: by all which, they do not onely approue vs, but gratifie vs with many great priuiledges, ſuch as neuer were granted to any other order of religion, as you might vnderſtand by me yeſterday.

                  <hi>Aduoc.</hi> A great obiection forſooth: for you could not poſſibly fight againſt me with any better weapons: &amp; I am right glad, that my whole diſcourſe, begins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, &amp; ends, according to the authority of the holy ſea.</p>
               <q>Abs Ioue principium, Iouis omnia plena.</q>
               <p>The holy Sea hath approued of you, (ſay you) I grant it, only to pleaſure you. Therefore they that allow not of your ſocietie, are heretiques: I denie that. The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Diuines, and the Vniuerſitie of Paris, our whole Church of Fraunce, ſo many ſocieties, ſo many of worth and honour, made themſelues parties againſt you, in the yeere 64. and diſalowed of you: yet for all that, ye neuer heard, that they were decleard at Rome to be heretiques. Inſomuch, that the Popes which authoriſed you, neuer thought that you were to inhabit in France. They knew that their dignitie, is the mother of vnitie in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church. They were not ignorant of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Church of Fraunce, wholy contrarie to the profeſſion of the Ieſuits: and that to ſettle them in Fraunce, had beene to plant a huge ſort of ſchiſmes and diuiſions. Whereby you may perceiue the reaſon, why they repeald not the iudgements that had paſt againſt theſe goodly Maiſters, as well in the conuocation of our whole Cleargie at Poiſie, as in the Parliament at Paris. Following herein, by a good inſpiration of God and his holy Spirit, the ſteps of <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, to whom when the Ieſuits preſented themſelues at the firſt, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14558:87"/>that they would goe into Paleſtine, and there ſettle theyr aboade for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerting of the Turkes,<note place="margin">Maſf. lib. 2. capit. 3. Ribad. lib. 2. capit. 7.</note> they were not onely fauourably entertaind by him, but, which is more, he cauſed money to be deliuerd to them for the defraying of the charge of theyr voyage. But when they returnd the ſecond time, to haue a confirmation of their new determination, Pope <hi>Paule</hi> was two whole yeeres before hee could yeelde to it. And why ſo? Becauſe in theyr firſt proiect, there was no danger to Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but onely to themſelues, that were the vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of this matter. In the ſecond, there was aſſurance for their perſons, but great hazard &amp; danger to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome. And after many denialls &amp; refuſals, although he ſuffered himſelfe to be carried away by Cardinall <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarens</hi> importunitie, yet he was of opinion, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were not to take vp theyr dwelling in Fraunce, but not to continue in any other part of Chriſtendome, but verie ſparingly.</p>
               <p>Howe then? Shall wee thinke that this great Pope, would leaue deſolate this new Order approued by him? No truly. And if you will examine this ſtorie aright, you will reſt ſatisfied. If in the yeere 1539. the Ieſuits had made promiſe of no more, but the 3. ſubſtantiall vowes of other religious orders, he would neuer haue admitted them in ſuch a faſhion as they preſented themſelues: Munks, who by a title appropriated to themſelues, were termed of the ſocietie of Ieſus, wearing no religious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite at all. Munks, that would not tie themſelues to their Cloyſters, there to leade a ſolitarie life, nor reduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the extraordinarie abſtinence from meates, and to the faſts of other religious orders. Munks, that would preach and adminiſter the holy Sacraments, without the permiſſion of the Biſhop. For all theſe circumſtances layd together, promiſe (I cannot tell what) great diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, rather then edification.</p>
               <p>What then prouokt him to receiue them? Firſt, their
<pb facs="tcp:14558:88"/>vow of abſolute obedience to the holy Sea: afterward, that of their Miſſion: by which <hi>Ignace</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions promiſed, that when ſoeuer they ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the Popes, they would goe into all heathen Countries, to diſpeople them (as it were) of Idolatry, &amp; to plant Chriſtianitie in them. They were a company of Argonautes, which promiſed to embarque themſelues, not to goe conquer the golden Fleece, like <hi>

               <p>A goodly profeſſion doubtleſſe, in fauour whereof, Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> ſuffred theſe newe pilgrims, which tooke the croſſe for the glorifying of the Name of Ieſus, to terme themſelues the ſocietie of Ieſus, to weare the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Prieſts, not of Munks, not to ſhut themſelues vp in Cloyſters, to miniſter the word of God, and the holy ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, one with another: for as much as they vowed themſelues to the conqueſt of thoſe Countries, wherein there were no Biſhops not Curats: a conqueſt to be made, not with materiall armes, but only with ſpirituall. Send them to the new found Lands, according as they promiſd to goe, neuer was there order in greater requeſt then this, prouided, that they acquit themſelues of their promiſe, not by word, but effect. Tranſplant them into the midſt of the Chriſtian Churches, &amp; eſpecially of this our Church of Fraunce, in ſted of order, you ſhall make diſorder, of as dangerous a conſequence, as the ſect of the Lutherans.</p>
               <p>And that no man may thinke I make fantaſticall and idle diſcourſes, in the Bull of the yere 1540, repeated all at large in that of 1550, they promiſe to goe, without ſhifting or delay, whether ſoeuer the Pope will ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the ſauing of ſoules, and aduauncing our fayth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Turks, or to other miſcreants, euen to thoſe parts, which they call the Indies; or to any heretikes or ſchiſmatiks, or to any belieuers.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:14558:88"/>
               <p>If the meaning were, to make new ſeminaries of them through all Chriſtendome, it were a ridiculous thing, to ſet the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries of belieuing Chriſtians, in the laſt place: beſides, it ſeemes, that theſe words [or to any beleeuers] are added but by the way, and as it were for a faſhion. But theſe great promiſers and trauailers, forgetting what theyr firſt inſtitution was, haue ſet vp onely ſome doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Colledges, ſuch as they be, in Countries vnknowne to vs, (at the leaſt if we muſt belieue them) &amp; haue erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an infinite ſort in the midſt of vs, to plant thereby a newe Popedome, and to trample vnder foote the old, vnder which, the Church militant hath triumphed.</p>
               <p>Wee are not out of the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe we condemne theſe new Friers in Fraunce, but we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelues without Sophiſtrie, to the originall and primitiue wills of the Popes, <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> the third; and though their wills had been otherwiſe, yet our Ch. of Fraunce, hath time out of minde, beene accuſtomed, moſt humbly to make the caſe knowne to the Popes, when they were to be carried away by the vniuſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of particuler men, to the preiudice of the church.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E may not thinke Gentlemen, that <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> and his companions, when they preſented themſelues to Pope <hi>Paulus,</hi> made offer to teach the youth, in ſuch ſort, as the Ieſuits ſince that time haue done. I haue ſhewed you what his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie was in all parts of good learning. It was he that ſet the firſt plant of theyr ſocietie, and knowing his own ſmall forces, hee promiſt onely to teach little children theyr Creede, as our Curats doe, or their Vicars in pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Schooles: which I wil proue to be true by the courſe of this ſtorie.</p>
               <p>When they came firſt to Rome, to receiue the Popes bleſſing againſt their pretended voyage into the holie Land, <hi>Maffee</hi> ſaith, that during their aboade, according to the auncient cuſtome of the Church,<note place="margin">Maſſ. lib. 2. capit. 9.</note> they endeuourd to catechize the common people and the children from ſtreete to ſtreete. And afterward, when they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to draw theyr articles for their future ſocietie: <hi>Ac ſimul concepta verborum formula ſeſe obstringerent, pueriſi aetati per Catacheſim instituendae.</hi> The ſame thing is repeated by <hi>Ribadiner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ribad. lib. 2. cap. 13.</note> who ſaith, that this article was then agreed on by them, <hi>Pueros rudimenta fidei doceant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs come nowe to theyr Bulls, and firſt to that of 1540. by which, the wiſe <hi>Paulus</hi> 3. fearing all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of theſe new Aſſociats, after much importunitie, ſigned their Bill, but with this charge, that they ſhould
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14558:89"/>not be aboue three-ſcore. See what the beginning and promiſe of this ſupplication was, <hi>Quicunque in ſocietate, quam Ieſu nomine inſigniri cupimus, vult ſub crucis vexillo, deo militare, et ſoli Domino, ac Eccleſiae ipſius ſponſae, ſub Ro. Pontifice, Chriſti in terris vicario, ſeruire, post ſolemne casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, paupertatis, et obedientiae votum, proponat ſibi in animo, ſe partem eſſe ſocietatis, ad hoc potiſſimum institutae, vt ad ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei defenſionem, &amp; propagationem, et profectum animarum in vita &amp;. doctrina Christiana, per publicas praedicaciones, &amp; verbi dei ministerium, ſpiritualia exercitia, &amp; cantus opera, &amp; nominatim per pueroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp; rudiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>in Chriſtianiſmo institui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And becauſe this latter clauſe might receiue ſome doubtfull conſtruction, it is in a fewe wordes expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a little after in the ſame Bull. <hi>Et nominatim commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datam habeant institutionem puerorum et rudium in doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Christiana, decem praeceptorum, et aliorum ſimiliter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementorum.</hi> Thys is cleere, &amp; yet they might haue Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, not euery where, but in approoued Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and not to receiue for ſchollers, all commers and goers, but onely them that are of their Seminarie.</p>
               <p>

As for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they were onely to teach little children their creed, as we ſee the Maiſters of our Presbyteries doe. That ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by this word <hi>(Puer)</hi> which ſignifies an age, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but not much, exceeding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom the Romans calld Infants. And indeed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we would noate an old man, who by the feeblenes of his yeeres becomes a child againe, we ſay that he doth <hi>Repueraſcere.</hi> An infant is he
<pb facs="tcp:14558:90"/>that can neither goe nor ſpeake. <hi>Puer,</hi> is an infant that begins to goe and ſpeake, and ſo is he expreſt by <hi>Horace,</hi> in his booke of the Art of Poetry.</p>
               <q>Reddere qui voces iam ſcit puer, &amp; pede certo ſignat humum.</q>
               <p>In the yeere 1543. it was permitted the Ieſuits to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, without any limitation of number, all them that would be of theyr order. And as Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> opened the doore to them on this ſide, ſo did hee ſhuth on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For in the Bull of 43. there is rehearſal made, word by word, of the priuiledges that were graunted them by the firſt, of 1540. but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the inſtructing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their Creed, there is no mention at all, which I beſeech you to conſider. In the yeeres 45. and 46. theyr priuiledges were greatly encreaſt, and ſingulerly in the yeere 49, yet there is no ſpeech in any of them, of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children, although in theſe latter, there is expreſſe mention made againe, of Colledges ordayned for them of theyr Order.</p>
               <p>If you deſire to know the reaſon, and whence this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie proceedes, I will tell you. When by theyr firſt creation, there might be but three-ſcore of theyr ſociety, Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> made no great dainties to open the pettie Schooles for them, to teach little children theyr Creed: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſet open a wide gate for all men that would, to be of their ſocietie, then his meaning was, they ſhould be framed after the faſhion of other religious orders and Monaſteries, which may teach no other youth, but ſuch as are of their ſeuerall Orders.</p>
               <p>In this eſtate they liued till the yeere 49. in which Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> died, whom <hi>Iulius</hi> the third ſucceeded. They had to do in the beginning with a Pope, who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit being ouercom by the importunities of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he yeelded in the end, yet ſtill kept them vnder. But vpon the ſuddaine, after his diceaſe, they learned <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Lacedemonians leſſon, who ſaide, that a good
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14558:90"/>Captaine muſt be clad in the skinne of a Foxe and of a Lion: a leſſon afterward recommended by <hi>Machiauill</hi> in his inſtitution of a Prince. Looke not in the courſe of this ſtorie following, for any thing in your Ieſuits, but Foxe-like, and Lyon-like: and ſo doing you ſhall finde that they haue proued braue ſchollers of <hi>Machiauell. Ignace</hi> a verie wiſe worldling, vnderſtanding that there were many nouelties brought into the ſocietie, which he had deuiſed, contrary to the auncient order and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of our Church: ſo that a man could verie hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like of them, conceiued that it was needfull for him to haue a new confirmation by <hi>Iulius;</hi> marry he would get ſome new priuiledge by the bargain. I told you, that by the firſt Bul of <hi>Paulus,</hi> the Ieſuits were permitted to teach little children the firſt enterance into their Creed, to preach and to haue Colledges founded to bring vp, and inſtruct their youth, the nurſerie of their Societie, and none other, &amp; that afterward, in al the other Buls follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although all their priuiledges were confirmed, yet there was no mention of this ordinaunce for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>They preſented their ſupplication to <hi>Iulius,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at large their former, of the yeere 1540. and with a tricke of foxerie foiſted in this word <hi>Lectiones,</hi> which was not mentioned in the former Bull, and then they ſet downe all that, which had paſt in the other Buls: and for their Colledges, they bring in a new paſſe-right. But it is beſt to read the places themſelues. <hi>Ignace</hi> by this new ſupplication, takes vp againe his <hi>Quicunque in ſocietate noſtra &amp;c. Proponas ſibi in animo ſe partem eſſe ſocietatis ad hoc potiſsimum institutae, vt ad fidei defenſione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; profectum animaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in vita &amp; doctrina, Chriſtiana per publicas praedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones Lectiones, &amp; aliud Dei quodcun<expan>

                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:91"/>the other, in the Catechizing of young children, which hath beene taken from them euer ſince the yeere 1543. And yet, all this is not inough for the eſtabliſhing of their Colledges, &amp; their ordinary tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the youth, in ſuch ſort, as they afterward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocht vpon theſe things. By theſe Buls, they were permitted to read now and then publikely in Diuinitie, as we ſee their fellow <hi>Maldonatus</hi> did, twiſe vpon feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall daies: firſt in expounding the Canon of the Maſſe, afterward, vpon the Pſalme, <hi>Dixit Dominus Domino meo.</hi> Otherwiſe, that laſt reſtaint to the teaching of little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, had beene in vaine, if the word <hi>Lectiones,</hi> might reach to the publike exerciſe of all ſorts of learning, ſuch as is in other Colledges.</p>
               <p>And in theſe publike Lectures of Diuinitie, that were to be read, as Sermons and Inſtructions for the aduna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of our faith, there was no innouation at all againſt our auncient diſcipline. For although religious perſons might not teach any, but them of their owne order, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning and Philoſophie, yet they were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to read publiquely in Diuinitie: and ſo our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſaw one <hi>Cenomani</hi> a Iacobin, and one <hi>De Cornibus</hi> a Franciſcan, and we of late yeres, <hi>Panigarole,</hi> read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Lectures of Diuinitie in Paris.</p>
               <p>All the alteration that I gather, out of this Bull 1550, is, that whereas by that of 1540. they were forbidden to haue Colledges any where, but in approued Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in this of <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, they are permitted to haue them in all other places.

               <p>This was the ſupplication which they preſented, and <hi>Iulius</hi> ſigned, wherein you may find ſome obſcuritie in theſe words [Societie profeſt] and in other, which I will cypher vnto you when opportunitie ſhall ſerue. Let it ſuffiſe, that in this paſſage, there is no other noueltie, but that wheras by their firſt Bull, they might haue no Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, but in approoued Vniuerſities, by this, they are permitted to haue them in all places, whereſoeuer anie man will found any Churches of theyr Societie, which they in their language, call Houſes. Theſe words, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Monaſteries, offended their daintie eares. And moreouer you ſee, that the Colledges which are ſpoken of, annexed to their Houſes, are not ordaind but for the ſchollers of their Order. And in this new alteration, yet this was not to alter any thing in the auncient gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Vniuerſities. For all other orders of religion in theyr Monaſteries, ſcattered heere and there in theyr Prouinces, teach their Nouices, &amp; afterward ſend them to the Vniuerſities, there to perfect their ſtudies, and to
<pb facs="tcp:14558:92"/>take degrees in Diuinitie, if they be found fit for it. And thence it comes, that there is not a Monaſterie of anie noate, that hath not a houſe in that great and famous V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie of Paris, to lodge the religious of their Order, which are to proceed in Diuinitie.</p>
               <p>See heere the beginning of the ruine and generall change of the auncient eſtate of our Vniuerſities. Wee knew not what it meant, to make religious perſons Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Arts, and much leſſe, to make them take theyr degrees in Diuinitie, other where then in Vniuerſities, whether all ſorts of publique trialls for learning are brought. <hi>Iulius</hi> the third ouerthrew this wiſe cuſtome, in fauour of the Ieſuits. For hee ordaind that a Ieſuit, whereſoeuer hee haue beene ſtudent, in Vniuerſitie, or otherwiſe, ſhould take gratis all degrees, of Bachiler, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Licentiat, Practitioner, and Doctor, in any facultie whatſoeuer; and that if any man would exact of him, that which by an honeſt &amp; laudable cuſtome hath been receiued of antiquitie, notwithſtanding, hee ſhould goe out Maiſter or Doctor, vpon the onely credit &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his Generall, and ſhould enioy from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, all the priuiledges, freedoms, and liberties that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe.</p>
               <p>This Pope was of a very fantaſticall iudgement. You know the ſtorie of his great Ape, that would not be ruld by any body, but a little begger boy, of which hee, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Cardinall <hi>de Monte,</hi> tooke ſuch a liking, that afterward beeing made Pope, hee gaue ouer to him all his Benefices, and made him a new Cardinall: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the vertuous &amp; honourable perſonages of Italie, called him Cardinall Ape. I doe not thinke it ſtrange then, that this Pope, pricked forward by ſuch an other fancy, would needs aduaunce to extraordinary degrees, and neuer before ſeene in the Vniuerſities, theſe Apes of our Catholique religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>They that haue been brought vp in the Latine tongue, ſhall finde, that <hi>Iulius</hi> ſpeakes onely of Ieſuits ſchollers. It is a clauſe that hath relation to all other the former Bulls, wherin there hath been ſpeech of their Colledges, and in this particularly it is ordained, that, although the ſchollers of this Order haue been ſtudents in Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or out of them, if after they haue been well and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examind, they be found fit, they ſhould be freely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the degrees of Practitioners and Doctors, (a word which cannot reach to ſtrangers) and that, if any man would make them pay duties, it ſhould be in the power of their Generall, to creat them, or to cauſe them to be created: and after they haue taken their degrees, they may read, diſpute, and keepe all other acts heerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to requiſit; in ſhort, that they may receiue the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues that others doe.</p>
               <p>What? will you ſtretch this worde (read) to all goers and commers, as in other Colledges of Maiſters that are Secular? No truly. For what power ſoeuer is here gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, it was graunted as to perſons that were Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, (for ſo they haue termed themſelues) and therefore, it was to giue theſe new Maiſters and Doctors, leaue to read to theyr ſchollers allowed, as if theyr degrees had beene giuen them by the Vniuerſities. Let the Ieſuit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good cuſtome, bring all the ſhifts of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtrie hee can, this paſſage, (if a man read it from the beginning to the end) can not be otherwiſe vnderſtood. If <hi>Iulius</hi> had meant that the Ieſuit graduated, might read to all goers &amp; commers, as the Seculars doe, aſſure your ſelfe, hee would not haue forgotten to make expreſſe mention of it.</p>
               <p>But you ſee (will ſome man ſay to mee) howe manie termes he hath giuen to the Ieſuits Lectures to authorize them. Doe you thinke that ſtrange? how could he doe leſſe? ſith that by a new deuiſe, neuer ſeene before, hee ordained, that vpon the ſimple credit of the Generall of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14558:93"/>this Order, the Ieſuits might read Lectures to them of their order. This pollicie, that ſo weakens all the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſinewes of the Vniuerſities, could not be ſufficiently expreſt for the authorizing of it.</p>
               <p>I haue hitherto declared vnto you, what, as then, was the eſtate of their Buls, concerning their Colledges, you ſhall now vnderſtand their hiſtorie to this purpoſe. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neither by the auncient cuſtome of the Vnuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, nor by the new grant of their Buls, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſet open their ſchooles to all ſorts of ſchollers, nor to haue in their Colledges any other but of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie: yet finding themſelues to be ſupported by Maiſter <hi>William du Prat,</hi> Biſhop of Clairmont, they ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelues in one of the Townes of his biſhoprick, called Billon, where they opened their Colledge not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them of their order, but alſo to all other the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. O ſingular obedience of French-men to the Church of Rome? They bragge that they haue Buls from <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, permitting them ſo to doe. At this word we thought, that the onely alledging of the title, ought to be held for a good and ſufficient title: And yet they had no title but of their owne Villaine, quoth I to a Gentleman of Gaſcoigne: who aunſwered me very readily, that he be beleeued it, becauſe they had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for their chiefe, Colledge in Fraunce, the Town of Villon. They vſed this word for Billon, as the Gaſcoigns are wont to pronounce <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> for <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> To which I replyed, that we need not to make any change of the letter; becauſe by our lawes, we were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bring into Bullion, all falſe and counterfait mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, and that the Colledges of the Ieſuits, were of that ſtampe.</p>
               <p>In the Towne of Billon this villanie tooke beginning, which afterward they ſpread abroad: firſt to Toloſa, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Paris, by meanes of the great legacies, that <hi>du Prat</hi> had giuen them. Neither durſt any of vs make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:14558:94"/>any of their vnlawful enterpriſes, ſo much did our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try of France honor the Sea Apoſtolik, vnder which they ſhielded themſelues, though falſely. We are indeed reuerently to yeeld obedience to that Sea, but cooſeners are not to be ſuffered to abuſe it for their aduantage, and there is none, whom it more concernes to looke to this, then our holy Father the Pope, if he meane to preſerue his authoritie ouer all, and againſt all. Good God, where are our eies? Let vs runne ouer all their Buls of 1540. 43.45.46.49. if you find, that they are permitted to hold and open their Colledges, in ſuch ſort as others of the Vniuerſities, I will yeeld my ſelfe to any ſentence, that ſhall be giuen againſt me. All their worthie actions are but cooſinages, and if you ſpeake of them in ſecret to them, they will tell you, that they are the miracles which God hath wrought by their Saint <hi>Ignace.</hi> When they firſt preſented themſelues to <hi>Paul</hi> the third to be admitted, they termed themſelues Maiſters of Arts, proceeded in the Vniuerſitie of Paris, and at this day, <hi>Maffee</hi> flouting the whole conſiſtorie of Rome, is of opinion, that three of them had proceeded Maiſters in Spaine, and that himſelfe and <hi>Ribadinere,</hi> would not giue any place of maiſterſhip to <hi>Broet, Iaye</hi> and <hi>Codury.</hi> And ſetting open their Colledges in Fraunce, they did but ſhroud themſelues vnder the authoritie of the Sea Apoſtolike; an authoritie falſely ſuppoſd by them. Whence came theſe illuſions? From the miracles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth of great <hi>Ignace,</hi> who blinded all mens eies.</p>
               <p>I will now returne againe to the courſe of their Buls, that you may vnderſtand, when this power to read Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to all ſchollers, was graunted them. After this, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the troubles in Fraunce, 1561, about diuerſitie of Religion: in the beginning whereof, the Ieſuits finding this a fit time for their aduantage, not by reaſon of any fauour to theyr ſect, but becauſe of diſpleaſure againſt that ciuill warre, obtayned by a manifeſt forgerie, newe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14558:94"/>Bulls of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, the tenure whereof is this.</p>

               <p>This decretall, was the firſt opener of their Colledges to all manner of ſchollers: but whereupon was it groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Vpon the Bull of <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, as it is twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. Was there euery any greater forgery, or more craftie conueiance then this? For Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> neuer had any ſuch thought; and that is the reaſon why theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters, haue cauſed to be added in the end of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourths Bull, that no man may accuſe them of obrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſurreption, or of any wilfull fault; being deſirous that euery one of vs ſhould ſhut his eyes, and blindfolde his vnderſtanding, that wee might not take any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:14558:95"/>of that apparant ſhame, which is brought in a new, againſt the auncient honour of the Vniuerſities, by which our Church hath alwayes beene kept in ſtrength. But the Pope hath added this word <hi>(Ampliamus)</hi> will ſome Ieſuite of the loweſt forme ſay to me. Was there euer any poynt either of ſtate or Religion, more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, or of greater conſequence then this? I let paſſe that theſe newe Maiſters were permitted to be Graduats in all faculties, as it was graunted by <hi>Iulius</hi> his Bull.</p>
               <p>I graunt, that by this laſt Bull of <hi>Pius,</hi> there Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were opened to all commers and goers: both the one &amp; the other notwithſtanding, being new ſchiſmes in our Vniuerſities. But who can abide this, that theyr ſchollers muſt be admitted to practiſe, whether they be Ieſuits or ſtrangers, vpon the teſtimonie of two or three of their order, ſo they pay their duties to the Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Rectors, Preſidents, &amp; vnder-Gouernours of the Vniuerſities? Is not this to make the Superiors of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, no better then Regiſters to the Ieſuits &amp; theyr ſchollers? Is not this to diſgrace the Gouernours of the Vniuerſities without deſert?</p>
               <p>Is not this, by ſubmitting them to the conſcience of their Generall, and two or 3. of his, to bring in a Chaos, hotch-potch, and confuſion of all thinges in our Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities? And to ſay the truth, there is no better meanes then that, by making a Seminary of Ieſuits, to make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a nurſerie of Hereticks, by committing the Doctorſhips &amp; Maiſterſhips of ſchollers, to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe new Templars. Sith this depends vppon this one word <hi>(Ampliamus,)</hi> which was craftilie foyſted in, by theſe maiſter workmen in ſuch tricks of legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, we ſhall admit this new diſorder: thereupon the Pope ſhall ſtop his owne eares, and our mouthes, that the ſhifts, obreptions and ſurreptions of theſe reuerend Fathers in God, may not be diſcried, &amp; all becauſe this laſt clauſe was added, by a Clark of the Court of Rome,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14558:95"/>that copied out the graunt. Read all the 7. former Buls, ye ſhall find no ſuch clauſe in any of them. Why did they cauſe it to be added in this? Becauſe they knew in their conſcience, that this laſt Bull was obtained by obreption, contrarie to all reaſon. If I ſhould appeale to their conſciences, they would make a mocke at me. For the ſame yeere, that they got this Bull at Rome, (which was 1561.) they promiſt in a full aſſembly of the Church of Fraunce, that they would renounce all the extraordinarie priuiledges, that had beene graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them at Rome. This abiuration they confirmed by publique oath in a full Court of Parliament, but they neuer performed it. And that which is eſpecially to bee conſidered, they lookt to themſelues verie carefully, for preſenting the Popes priuie Buls, either to our Cleargy, or to our Parliament. For if they had ſhewed them, they had beene not only derided, but alſo abandoned, as men that had no wit. Hitherto you haue deſcried in them, good ſtore of the Foxes craft, now you ſhall ſee how they haue playd in Lions. For, the yeere 1571. they got other Buls of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, of this forme and ſubſtance.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14558:96"/>youth, by the Ieſuits, and how by little and little they haue got ground, againſt the auncient orders of the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſities. Hauing employed all ſorts of vnlawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes and ſhifts, which are familiar, not to learned men, but to the baſeſt of the people; who abuſing the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power of the holy Sea, bring, if I may dare to ſay ſo, the Popedome and the reſt of the people to liue vpon almes. By theſe clauſes of the Chancery of Rome, they thinke to fight with vs, with edge tooles. And a Procter generall, might rebate them brauely by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, as by abuſe, becauſe theſe Buls were not onely wrung out by deuiſes, but doe alſo, directly vſurpe vpon the liberties of our Church of Fraunce, the ordinarie rights and priuiledges of our Vniuerſities. For why ſhould not this appeale be receiued, ſith that the Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Venice, according to their wiſe carriage in all their actions, knowing the diſorder, that theſe newe people bring with them, haue expreſly forbidden them by an act made the 23. of December, 1591. to reade publique or priuate Lectures to anie, but thoſe that are of their Societie? Which act, a man cannot ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently commend, and which proues, that we are verie dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards if we doe not follow their example.

Can it be, that our good old Fathers, faild in iudgement, and that wee are now conſtrained to haue recourſe to theſe new Fathers. There neuer was wiſer diſcipline then that of theirs. For they thought, that alwaies the firſt obiects ſeeme faireſt to children, &amp; that their wits, like wax, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue very eaſily all ſorts of impreſſions.</p>
               <p>They thought, that they ought not to ſuffer them to be ſeduced, but to let them enter into religious Orders, with an honeſt libertie of their conſciences, whereas by going ordinarilie to the Munks lectures, they might be conuerted in haſt to that, whereof they would repent themſelues afterward at leyſure; when there was no time f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If they perceiue any of their ſchollers begin to affect them, them they drawe to their net, and as ſoone as they haue taken them, they make them vaniſh out of their Parents ſight, to the end they may not be recouerd.

After this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they all employ themſelues in diuers maner in this goodly and fruitfull labour, one, by auricular confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, another, by allurements, a third, by priuate exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in his chamber, and it is meruailous hard for a poore youth to rid himſelfe out of their nets, eſpeciallie beeing ſo watcht.</p>
               <p>Yet I will tell you a ſtorie of a young man of great hope, in the ſurpriſall of whom, they faild of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. They perceiued, that hee had many good parts, &amp; yet had his mind greatly inclind to deuotion: they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gind thereupon, that hee would be a very fit pray for them. This youth, being pencioner in their Colledge at Paris, one of their Fathers began to ſet his fowling Nets for him, and among other talke, askt him, if it ſo fel out that it ſhould pleaſe God to call him out of the world, what would moſt diſquiet him at the houre of his death. The feare of the other world, (quoth the youth) becauſe of the ſinnes I haue committed. What would you ſay then, (replies the Ieſuit) to him that ſhould free you of this feare? I would think my ſelfe greatly bound to him, ſaid the youth. You may aſſure your ſelfe of deliuerance from this feare, (concludes the Ieſuit) if you will wholie become one of ours. For our ſocietie of Ieſus, is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittall from all ſinnes. This young boy beeing thus
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14558:98"/>managed, gaue full credit to his ſpeech, and had quickly truſt vp his pack to be gone, according to the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hee had receiued, which were, that without taking leaue of Father or mother, he ſhould firſt goe to one of their houſes which they would name to him, and there he ſhould receiue certaine money to ſerue his turne, till he came to another; &amp; ſo hauing in euery of theſe hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes mony to defray the charges of his voyage, he ſhould come at the laſt to Rome, there to receiue ſuch inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theyr General would giue him.</p>
               <p>When hee was vpon the very poynt of his departure, by good hap his Father came to ſee him, and found him quite changed: hereupon, he was deſirous to know the cauſe of his change: the boy refuſd to tell him, but the Father preſt him hard, and coniurd him with a fatherly ſeueritie, not to hide the matter from him. At the laſt, he vnderſtood all that had paſt, whereupon hee preſently tooke him away from that houſe, and after that all theſe fumes were vapourd out of his braine, ſent him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colledge, where hee profited ſo well, that I aſſure my ſelfe, he will proue very rare in the vocation which now he followes, and will prayſe &amp; thank God as long as he liueth, that it pleaſed him of his gracious mercy, to deliuer him from ſo dangerous a ſhipwrack.</p>

And all this is, becauſe he might neuer after vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any loathing of their new rebellion, returne home to his fathers houſe. But I beſeech our Ieſuits to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber this holy leſſon: for I hope to put them in minde of it hereafter, to better purpoſe in his proper place.

               <p>This is that I lookt for of them: after that they haue made their approach ſtep by ſtep, they are at laſt come to the wall, and there lacks nothing but to ſcale it, or to enter the breach, for the winning of the Towne. What may we looke for of this award vpon arbitrement, but that we read of <hi>Q. Fabius Labeo,</hi> who being choſen Arbitrator by the Senate of Rome, to decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betwixt the Nolans and Neopolitans, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their bounds, after he had ſurueyed the place, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with each of them apart, he councelled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to be wedded to their own wils, but rather to chooſe peace then purſue their quarrell. To which when both parts had condeſcended, for reſpect they had to him, after he had ſet each of them their bounds as pleaſed him, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to the people of Rome, all the ground which remained betwixt them, and for which they had beene in ſtrife. Wherein they could not complaine (ſaith <hi>Valerius</hi>) becauſe they had put the matter to his honeſtly, and ſo (ſaith this author) by a diſhoneſt ſhift, the Citie got a new tribute. I know well, the iudgement I giue of them, will be ſubiect to cauelling, and that ſome will ſay, that the Gloſſe goes beyond the text, for ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grudge I beare them. But I call God to witnes, that I wiſh not their hinderance in any thing, but as I conceiue it makes for the common good. I enuie not other Monaſteries, for that they which enter into them, preſent them with their goods, becauſe I do not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14558:100"/>ſee that they enter thereinto by craftie enticements, but vpon deuotion guided by the holy Ghoſt: but as for the Ieſuits, they take quite another courſe. There is nothing but the hand of man that cunningly workes the matter by a long traine. Firſt of all, in teaching the yong boyes, whether Pencioners or others, they caſt their eyes vpon them that are for their purpoſe, and make a Catalogue of their ſufficiency and capacities, which they ſend (as I told you) to their Generall, winning them afterward with ſweet allurements. When they are once won, they ſteale them away from thoſe, to whom they appertaine, and ſend them into other countries, to make them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their friends. After, when they are faſt in their nets, and are now readie to giue their farewell to the world, they are perſwaded by force, to leaue nothing to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mother, or kinred, but to giue all to the poore. But to what poore? That is not expreſt. And ſurely, he were of a verie dull capacitie that would not iudge, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this generalitie, they meane to ſpeake for themſelues in particular; and that in this choiſe, the young man wil ayme chiefely at their ſociety, vnto which he is about to vow himſelfe, and which he thinks to be the vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Catholique Church. To conclude, if his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous conſcience, haue any ſcruple by reaſon of the pouertie of his parents, yet is he not ſuffered to extend his liberalitie to them, but this doubt or perplexitie is committed to the iudgement of two or three of their Ieſuits. What is all this, but to tyrannize ouer this poore man, by a long trayne of words and cariage of matters, and to conſtraine him, when all comes to all, to beſtow his goods on this poore Societie, vpon which ſo much wealth is heapt? But if hee would conteſt to the contrarie, they will make him at his firſt enterance beleeue, that hee will prooue a diſobedient childe, and one that neuer will haue anie deuotion to their order.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14558:101"/>
               <p>But (as thought is free) let vs ſuppoſe that theſe two or three pretended wiſe men hauing giuen ſentence in fauour of their ſocietie, what appeale ſhall this new Ieſuit goe ſeeke to plead againſt them? He (I ſay) who for his firſt leſſon, receiues commaundement, to forget that holy truſt committed to him by God, I meane, the loue of his father and mother, to obey his ſuperiours, will he think you, dare once lift vp his eye lid to make head againſt them? And yet notwithſtanding, why ſhould we blame them for this ſentence? For they may ſay without going ſo about the buſh, that they are the Apoſtles of our time, as they haue cauſed themſelues to be called in Portugall, and that as in the primitiue Church at Ieruſalem, they that would be Chriſtians, were bound to bring all their goods and reuenewes to the Apoſtles feet; ſo theſe holy and deuout ſoules, will haue all bound, who will enter inter into their ſocietie, to make them partakers of all their goods. And for all this doe you ſay that I am not their moſt humble, and moſt affectionnate ſeruant? To conculde, in all <hi>Riba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> I find nothing ſo fine, as when he tels vs, that <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will be more charitable to them then they are to vs. Let vs not enuie them the good that they get by theyr newe gueſts, if by theyr Lectures they haue furniſht vs with many braue men for the gouernment of our Realme. I pray you tell me Gentlemen, whether your children, vvhich you haue committed to their teaching, haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their companions, in matter of learning or publique charge, or no? Shall you finde in the high Courts, anie Preſidents or Counſailers of the Ieſuits bringing vp, that excell others? I do not only ſee none ſuch, but quite contrarie, eyther we haue none ſuch at all, or very few; in whom likewiſe, you ſhall finde no other diſpoſition but ſad and heauie, no way ſociable with pubilque per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>They that are brought vp in other Colledges, not with fantaſtique aſſemblies, but with courage, in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient religion, are preferd to all places of charge, as well temporall, as Eccleſiaſticall. The Ieſuits ſhoote at no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marke, but the growth and greatnes of theyr owne Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale, becauſe (that I may not lie to you) theyr Schoole brings forth ſome men of marke, pickt &amp; cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen among their ſchollers. Theſe are ſuch, as in theyr youth ſuborned by the auncients, haue beene taken by craft, in whom age cannot quench the naturall fire that was in them. Afterward vnprofitable for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.</p>
               <p>And verily, it was fit that God ſhould muffle our eies, when we firſt ſuffered the Ieſuits, not onely to read, but
<pb facs="tcp:14558:102"/>to read gratis: that we might not perceiue, that the offer they made to the Vniuerſitie of Paris, was like the artificiall horſe the Greeks ſaid they had made to offer to <hi>Palladiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the Image of the goddeſſe <hi>Pallas,</hi> which was in Troy. A horſe, which notwithſtanding, caried in it ſelfe the ruine and deſtruction of the Citie. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are we beguiled by the Ieſuits, who counterfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to preſent a <hi>Pallas</hi> to Fraunce, in Paris, to wit, their Colledge, they haue laid our famous Vniuerſitie in the duſt.</p>
               <p>A generation of Vipers, no ſooner brought forth, but they killed their mother. For <hi>Ignace</hi> and his nine companions, when they preſented themſelues to Pope <hi>Paule,</hi> were no further qualified then Maiſters of Arts in Paris, as I told you of late. But with what eies ſhal we ſee, that they who by their vowes promiſed pouerty, as well in generall, as particular, either would or could, ſhew liberalitie worthie of a Monarch, that is, to teach and take nothing? Before they came here, the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie flouriſht, it was a common Port, where the greateſt part of all the Nations of Europe did ride at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor. Which you may perceiue, as well by the foure anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and great ſchooles ſtanding in Straw ſtreet, as by the Proctors of the Nations, next the Rector: For there is one ſchoole and one procter for for the Germane Nation, vnder which is comprehended, the Engliſh, Scotiſh, and others. If any ſpeake of this Vniuerſitie, they ſaid, learning was come to found Athens in Rome, and Rome in Paris. The ofspring of the good houſes of Fraunce, eyther when they were firſt ſent out to learne, or if they had begunne their ſtudies in other Townes, yet at laſt, their generall <hi>Rende-Vous,</hi> was in Paris, to attaine to the accompliſhment of learning there.</p>
               <p>The Principalls, lodgd in their Colledges the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, whom they call Pentioners, with moderate penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14558:102"/>and of ſtrangers, they tooke for theyr admiſſion, one ſhilling, or two at the moſt. The Regents had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine beneuolences of their Auditors, which they called Fayrings, of one more, of another leſſe, as it pleaſed their Parents to beſtow: for no man was bound, but onely by a certaine ſhame, which hee conceiued by the honeſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie of his fellowes. The Regent had no action at all againſt them for the recouering of one penny, and yet the matter was carried with ſuch modeſtie, that the Regents hauing ſwet and trauaild about the inſtruction of their youth, they were bound to feaſt them one day in a Garden, where they brought into practiſe that aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient libertie, which the Maiſters of Rome were wont to giue to their ſchollers in their Saturnalia.</p>
               <p>No man can ſay, that there was one iot of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in all theſe proceedings, neither did you euer ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Principalls or Regents growe to great wealth: and yet euerie one ſtudied to his vttermoſt endeuour, with no other intent, but to enrich himſelfe with a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, by beeing compaſt about in his Lectures with a great multitude of Schollers: as indeed there is no ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpurre to well doing then honor. The Principalls ſtroue by a certaine enuie one with another, who ſhould haue the beſt Regents to winne commendation, and by this means, the fame of the Vniuerſity of Paris was ſpred euery where.</p>
               <p>But vpon a ſuddaine, when it was not permitted, but tollerated in the Ieſuits, that they ſhould open theyr ſhops, all this honorable ambition, vaniſht into ſmoake. They called themſelues Protectors of the Catholique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: by meanes vvhereof, the Fathers of Children, that could ſee no farther before them then the length of their noſes, ſent theyr ſonnes thether, to abide and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by them.</p>
               <p>The ſchollers being not well confirmd, were verie glad to ſaue their Gate-mony, their Fayrings, and their
<pb facs="tcp:14558:103"/>candles: and ſo their Colledges being ſtuft full, theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall Ieſuits, beganne to take twice or thrice ſo much of their ſchollers for pention, as they tooke in other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; which the fooliſh fathers beſotted, neuer denied them. Hereupon, by little and little, the Readers &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of the Vniuerſitie, waxt cold in that deſire which before they had to make themſelues famous. This was, as it is with the Spleene in our bodies, which cannot grow, without the decay of other parts. In like ſort, the growing of the Ieſuit by this vnlawful cunning, was the ruine of the Vniuerſitie of Paris, which God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, now riſeth againe, euer ſince the Act of the Court of Parliament, in the yeere 1594.</p>
               <p>But what is become of all this? The Principalls and Regents, in the midſt of their famous couetouſnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine poore, and the Ieſuits, in the midſt of their craftie liberalitie, are become exceeding rich. And this is that, which Monſiure <hi>Du Meſnill,</hi> the Kings Atturney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, very wiſely ſaid to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſoris</hi> and <hi>Paſquier,</hi> when as they reaſond of the caſe of the Ieſuits, and the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie at the Kings-bench barre; <hi>Timeo Danaos &amp; dona fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</hi> I know that the meeke Ieſuit, in his ſupplication preſented to the King, affirmes, that our holy Father the pope, hath in Rome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to them, the inſtruction of the young Romane Nobilitie, amounting to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of 2000. ſchollers, and of fiue Seminaries of young men, Romans, Greeks, Engliſh, Dutch, Scottiſh. Wee enuie not either Rome or Italie this great happines, much leſſe the Ieſuits, who finde themſelues there to be very well and warme. They are permitted to become wholly Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionate, ſo they get them out of Fraunce, and let vs liue in quiet: and to that end, I giue them theſe two verſes following, to ſerue them for Letters demiſſories.</p>

                  <hi>Peter Abelard,</hi> comming of a verie auncient and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble houſe of Britaine, being the eldeſt of fiue brothers (which is no ſmall priuiledge in that countrey) gaue ouer all and euerie whit of his goods, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelfe to learning: wherein he was verie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, before he went out of the countrey. But to the end he might be better furniſht, he came to Paris, which then began to be the fountaine of all good litterature. There he found two Maiſters, <hi>William Campellenſis</hi> in Philoſophy, and <hi>Anſelm</hi> in Diuinitie, who read diuers lectures in the Biſhops Pallace, where the Vniuerſitie then was. <hi>Abelard</hi> had not ſtudied Philoſophie, but that, as he was of a great, but a running wit, ſo he farre out-ſtript his companions, and became equall euen to <hi>Campellenſis</hi> his Regent. And as one that was ſo, without taking any degree of licence, of his owne priuate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, he tooke the Doctors Chare: which being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him, he went and read at <hi>Corbueil,</hi> afterward, at <hi>Melun;</hi> from thence he came backe to Paris, where he read in the Suburbs. A certaine ſpace after, he ſtudied Diuinity vnder <hi>Anſelm,</hi> wherein he profited exceedingly, and vpon like extraordinarie confidence in himſelfe as before, he vndertooke to teach, without the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Vniuerſitie, to the great miſlike of all the auncients, yet not of the younger ſort, who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take pleaſure in ſuch nouelties. As he grew wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in all things, ſo there befell him a verie great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap. For he got a maide of good ſort with child, called <hi>Heloiſe,</hi> whom he was conſtrained to marry priuily, to ſatisfie her vncle, being a Canon of the Church of Paris.
<pb facs="tcp:14558:106"/>Afterward, being deſirous to conceale the marriage, and hauing put his wife into a cloyſter of Nuns at Arge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tueil, her vncle taking offence thereat, cauſed him a little while after to be taken at vnawares, and thoſe parts to be cut off, by which he had offended. In the end, ouercome with ſhame, his wound being perfectly whole, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Monke in the Abby of Saint <hi>Denis</hi> in Fraunce, and <hi>Heloiſe,</hi> a vailed Nunne in the Nunnery of Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tueil: yet could not this working ſpirit be reſtrained by the auncient diſcipline of our Church. For he began to ſet open a ſchoole, as well of Philoſophy, as of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, within his Monaſterie, drawing to him an infinite ſort of ſchollers. This thing made the Vniuerſitie of Paris to ſtirre againſt him by complaint to the Prelates. Which himſelfe alſo conceales not, in a long Epiſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the generall ſtorie of his life, out of the which I haue copied this paſſage.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This booke offended all the Cleargy of France. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, there was a Councell aſſembled in the Towne of Soiſſons, where <hi>Conan,</hi> Biſhop of Preuoſte, and Legate in Fraunce for the Sea Apoſtolique, was Preſident. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belard</hi> being heard ſpeake for himſelfe, and his booke being read; that was condemned as heriticall, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be burnt in open market, and he the author of it, was confined for euer into the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi> and expreſſe charge giuen him not once to come abroad. He had many ſchollers, whereof ſome were become Cardinals, and were neere about Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſecond. Inſomuch, that by their intreatie, he found means to be receiued again into the Monaſtery of Saint <hi>Dennis;</hi> where again he plaid the foole, though he ſcapt puniſhment for it. Thus he continued, till at laſt, hee had leaue of the king to withdraw himſelfe into Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne, and there he built an Oratory, which he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the trinitie, rather for reuenge, then deuotion, that he might ſet himſelfe againſt them that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his booke. But percerceiuing that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Prelates, and that he brought himſelfe into danger to be cenſured againe, he changed his name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Paraclet</hi> (which ſignifies Comforter) a name parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly conſecrated to the holy Ghoſt: meaning, that this place had beene the Hauen of his comfort, after he had paſt many tempeſts and ſtormes. Which againe offended our Church; as he himſelfe confeſſeth. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all Churches, (as I gather out of of him) had beene conſecrated in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt: yet there neuer was any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb facs="tcp:14558:107"/>to God the father, to God the Sonne, or to the bleſſed Spirit. To this obiection, he being a great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter, aunſwered, that if Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to the Corinths, commaunded that euery man ſhould build in himſelfe a ſpirituall Temple to the holy Ghoſt, no man ſhould thinke ill of it, that he had made a materiall temple. In this place, as he that ſought for nothing but nouelties, he opened publique ſchooles of Philoſophie and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie. Whereof many ſchollers, that were curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, being aduertiſed, they left the Townes to come to him, and to ſtay with him, building themſelues little Lodges and Cels, where they lay vpon the ſtraw: <hi>et pro delicatis cibis</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>herbis agreſtibus, &amp; pane pro cibario vtebatur.</hi> This indeed was, for him to ſet vp a new Sect, who had beene condemned by the Church and Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie. The preachers declaimed againſt him, as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall heretique, that diſpleaſed by his meanes, the Lords Temporall and Spirituall: but aboue all other, Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> tooke this quarrell in hand, as we ſee in his Epiſtles. For perceiuing, that notwithſtanding the ſentence of condemnation giuen by the Councell, <hi>Abelard</hi> continued opinionatiue in the teaching of his error, vnder the ſhadow of ſupports, and fauours he had in the Court of Rome, writing to Cardinall <hi>Yues.

               <p>The Ieſuits ſay, that <hi>Paſquier</hi> impiouſly accuſeth <hi>Maldonat</hi> the Ieſuit, of impietie, (theſe are the words they vſe) becauſe in one of his Lectures,<note place="margin">Fon. ca. 36.</note> he had proued to his ſchollers by naturall reaſons, that there is a God, in another, that there is none. And they themſelues are wholly heretiques, by the propoſition they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, when as thinking by the wings of their wits, to lift themſelues vp aboue Heauen, they fall downe into the bottomleſſe pit of Hell; or elſe Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſecond, Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> and our whole Church of Fraunce, are deceiued. But becauſe this is not the marke I ayme at, my intent being onely to examine, the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vnlikenes, that was betwixt <hi>Ignace</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes vpon the one part, and <hi>Abelard</hi> that great here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique and diſturber of our Vniuerſitie of Paris, on the other: I will put you in mind, that both the one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, came of great and noble houſes. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween them was, that <hi>Abelard</hi> was the eldeſt of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Ignace</hi> the yongeſt: he learned, &amp; of a great ſpirit, <hi>Ignace</hi> vtterly ignorant of all good learning. Thence it came, that the one would violently ſet vp his Sect like a Lion; and thereby ſunke vnder the waight of his hope: the other like a Foxe, who by that meanes, enlarged his.</p>
               <p>But if you take away theſe differences, they were very like in many other things. <hi>Abelard</hi> writ a booke of the Trinitie, which was condemned by the Church, <hi>Ignace</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:14558:108"/>made another of the ſame matter, which he himſelfe condemned; ſhewing himſelfe therein more wiſe and aduiſed then the other; <hi>Abelard</hi> without any degree of licence, would needs at the firſt marry himſelfe to the Chair, to read in the Vniuerſity of Paris. The very ſame thing did, not <hi>Ignace,</hi> who was a meere ignorant fellow, but his followers, the Ieſuits. So that you ſhal neuer find, any one of their firſt Regents which read in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of Paris, to be a Graduate. <hi>Abelard,</hi> being a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon of the Abbey of S. <hi>Dennis,</hi> taught both Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie and Diuinitie: the verie ſame that our religious Ieſuits do. The Vniuerſitie at that time tooke it ill, that Philoſophie was read by a Munke, to forraine ſchollers and ſtrangers: and it is alſo one of the principal articles of controuerſy with the Ieſuits. <hi>Abelard</hi> read Diuinitie without any degree of licence, whereof the Vniuerſitie complaind to the Prelats of Fraunce, yet did he nothing which the Ieſuits did not afterward, and do euen to this day: and it is one of the principall complaints of the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſity againſt them. <hi>Abelard,</hi> was condemned by our Church of France: <hi>Ignace</hi> &amp; his fellowes, firſt by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of Diuinitie in Paris, afterward, by our Church aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at Poiſſy. <hi>Abelard,</hi> brought in the hereſie, to proue that by natural reaſons, which depends vpon our Chriſtian faith: the Ieſuits, not only follow this damnable opinion, but maintaine that he is an Athieſt, &amp; impious, who beleeues in God with all humility, &amp; likes not that a man ſhould by naturall reaſons, proue to boyes, that there is a God, &amp; that there is none. <hi>Abelard</hi> was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported in the Court of Rome by Cardinals; and that is it, which ſpoiles vs at this day. For the Ieſuits fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all fauour there, abuſe it, and call all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heretiques that rely not vpon their hereſies. <hi>Abelard,</hi> was a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not religious, hauing indeed, nothing of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but the habit: Which gaue Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> occaſion to ſay, that hee was, <hi>Sine ratione Monachus, qui nec ordinem
<pb facs="tcp:14558:109"/>tenebat, nec tenebatur abordine.</hi> I pray you tell me what order the Ieſuits keepe, and by what order they are held. True it is, that <hi>Abelard</hi> was in his habit religious, and theſe men know not what it meanes. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Abelard</hi> repreſented <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> outwardly, and inwardly <hi>Herode.</hi> As for our Ieſuits, I neuer could acknowledge any thing of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt in their ſermons, but much of <hi>Herode</hi> in their cruelties, to make Princes be murthered, and to driue them out of their Realmes and Dominions. Yet there is one diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for theſe fellowes liue fat and faire, and are not bound by their conſtitutions to keepe extraordinarie faſts, as other orders doe: contrariwiſe, <hi>Abelards</hi> ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and followers, lay vpon the ſtraw in little cabins, and for their dyet, contented themſelues with bread and hearbs.</p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Abelard</hi> tooke to himſelfe apart, the great and holy name of <hi>Paraclet,</hi> for which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by our Diuines: and with a like zeale, the Ieſuits haue taken the name of Ieſus, which was forbidden the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The concluſion was alike, for notwithſtanding the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of our Prelats, the name <hi>Paraclet</hi> remaines yet to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belards</hi> Oratory, which at this day by a corrupt name we call <hi>Paraclit;</hi> and it is a houſe of Nuns, whereof <hi>Heloiſe, Abelards</hi> wife, was the firſt Abbeſſe: in like ſort the name Ieſus continueth with the Ieſuits, that they may in all points enioy <hi>Abelards</hi> priuiledges. And in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is not any one of them, that hath hit righter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their agreement with <hi>Abelard,</hi> then he that in the yeere 1594. defended the Colledge of Clairmont. Who, when <hi>Arnault,</hi> had freſhly obiected againſt them in a full Court of Parliament, the name &amp; quality of a Ieſuit, anſwered in ſcorne, that, that obiection, had beene made againſt them before, by Maſter <hi>Stephen Paſquier,</hi> and that it was out of date. One thing onely is wanting in this generall coreſpondence of <hi>Abelard</hi> with our
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14558:109"/>Ieſuits: namely, ſuch a worthy perſonage as S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> to be a meanes to the holie Sea, againſt theſe new trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of our Church, and our Vniuerſities. For when I ſpeake of him, I dare be bold to ſay, that God did ſpread in his hart, the beames and rayes of his holy Spirit, as much &amp; more then in any man that liued ſince his time.</p>

And yet I think it not onely excuſable, but commendable, when beeing of a competent age, a man betakes himſelfe to a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, though his Father and mother conſent not to it: but when theſe things are carried by the crafty conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Munks, the matter deſerues extraordinarie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p>A fewe yeeres ſince, there was great blame layd vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Charter-houſe Munks of Paris, for hauing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Fathers knowledge, receiued a young man into their Order. The Prior being ſent for about the matter, by the Court of Parliament, maintaind with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſolution, that hee was not bound to turne him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. We goe not to ſeeke them (quoth he) we liue a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie life, ſeuerd from the Towne, within the Towne: we allure them not to vs by Lectures or by conferences. Yea, contrariwiſe, wee make expreſſe profeſſion of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and they of our order, ſpeake to no man without leaue of their Superiour. If any man of ripe age, moued by the grace of the holy Ghoſt, be deſirous to become
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14558:110"/>one of our Order, why ſhould wee goe to procure any others good will, whom wee know from his infancie by the inſtinct of nature, not to be diſpoſed to ſuch deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This were to enuie God a goodly ſacrifice, readie to be offered to him, and wee ſhould be coutned tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the generall good of the Church, if wee ſhould deale otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The Court hauing heard his defence, diſmiſt him, without preſſing him any further, which they did not on the behalfe of the Ieſuits, in <hi>Airaults</hi> caſe.

Which if perhaps they doe not, beeing not won to that courſe but by themſelues, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, I doe not thinke (I will ſay it yet once againe,) that a man can blame them, or the Monaſterie that receiues them. But for the Ieſuit, the matter ſtands quite otherwiſe; and I remember, that I was one day with a poore Father enraged, who, hauing his ſonne ſtolne &amp; caried away, letting looſe the reines to his chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, with a troubled minde, ſpake on this manner to the Rector of the Ieſuits in Paris. I did not commit my ſon to thee to make a Ieſuit of him, but to inſtruct him in humane learning, that hee might not ſtray from our Catholique religion, with intent to make him heyre of my will, of my goods, and of my eſtate, ſuppoſing that thou hadſt ſome religion in thee. But where haſt thou found (thou lewd fellowe) that it is permitted thee, by auricular confeſſion, by a counterfeit deuotion, by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall ſpeeches, to ſeduce my poore child, to ſteale him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe, to ſteale him from his Father, to ſteale him from GOD? For why ſhould I not call it, ſtealing from God, when as for the firſt worke of his deuotion,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:111"/>thou teacheſt him, to ſteale himſelfe from his Father? An innocent I may call him, to whom by reaſon of the weakenes of his age, and vnderſtanding, thou haſt giuen no leyſure to bethinke himſelfe in conuenient time, of that which he hath promiſt to God, by making a vowe to liue a Munks life. Thou Iugler in matters of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion, which playeſt tricks of paſſe and repaſſe, to make a child paſſe, by inuiſibilities, (it is, it is not,) to the end thou maiſt withdraw him, both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Magiſtrats. And when thou haſt thus done, thou haſt vp thy generall prouerbe, Theſe be the works of thy holy ſpirit; whom thou haſt alwaies in thy mouth, as harlots are alwaies prating of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie.</p>

               <p>And, that after hee had employed his ſolitarineſſe in long watchings, and deuotions, hee might come out of his Cloyſter, as a worthy and valiant warriour, not to murder Kings, not to conquer Realmes, and to ſel them to him what would offer moſt, but to kill ſinne, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due diſordered ſoules, by preaching in the midſt of the churches, that which appertaines to euerlaſting bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

               <p>I ſaw a poore Father, in the Ieſuits Colledge in Paris, play hys part in this ſort: and to ſay the truth, I coulde haue wiſhed, that the good olde man, had ſome-what brideled his choller, which me thought paſt the bounds of modeſtie: but what modeſtie can a man looke for in a Father, that hath his ſonne ſtolne from him? There is no remedie, but he muſt needes be out of patience. In a worde, conſider I pray you the firſt griefe of a poore deſolate Father, who complaines not that his ſonne is become a religious perſon, but that it is wrought by the Ieſuits ſeducing, alluring, and cooſning.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ntending to entreate now from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, of the Ieſuits ſimple vowe, I heere vow, not to deale with them, but at their owne weapons. They haue bin alwaies hetherto ſo cunning that fewe men haue had any knowledge of theyr dealings. Their Bulls and their ſtatuts are, to this day, printed within their Colledges, ſo that no man knowes the Printers name, neither can they eaſily com into any ſtrangers hands: which hath beene the cauſe, that no man heeretofore, durſt ſpeake ſo boldly of them. But as the force of truth is ſuch, that in time it wil be diſcouerd, ſo the Caball of theſe Rabbines; could not be kept ſo ſecret, but that in tract of time, their bookes haue gotten out of their Colledges, vpon which I haue framed thys preſent diſcourſe. I will begin with their ſimple vowe, a vow, which I may ſay is new, and monſtrous, and which cannot be tollerated in our Church, without the ouerthrowing thereof, at the leaſt in regard of religious Orders and Monaſteries.</p>
               <p>By the Lecture which the Ieſuit read vs yeſterday, you vnderſtand, that the firſt vow of their Order, is that which they call the ſimple vow, by which, hee that will vow himſelfe to their Societie, makes at the firſt the 3. ordinarie vowes of all other religious Orders, namelie, of Chaſtitie, Pouertie, and Obedience. And although, in reſpect of himſelfe, hee may not after this vow, giue ouer his profeſsion, yet is it in the power of the General,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14558:112"/>when he will to diſmiſſe him, though hee haue beene a Ieſuit 25. yeeres: and, which is more, as long as he goes no farder then this ſimple vow, he is capable of all inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances direct and collaterall, notwithſtanding the vowe of pouertie hee hath made. Let vs not detract any thing from the honour due to the one and to the other, but let vs ſee what diſcourſe <hi>Montaignes</hi> hath made of theſe matters.</p>
               <p>By this diſcourſe (ſaith he,<note place="margin">Montag. ca. 50. de ſa ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due.</note> ſpeaking to <hi>Arnault</hi>) two lyes that you haue made ſhal be refuted; The one is, that no man euer makes this vow of pouertie, but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all hope of ſucceſsion is loſt. For it is made in the end of the Nouiceſhip, as hath been ſaid. Now, if notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this vow of Pouertie, they retaine ſometimes for many yeeres the proprietie of their goods, by theyr Superiors leaue, and are capable of inheritances, be not offended thereat, neither call the Ieſuits couetous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For this retayning, is not for them who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this right, as I ſaid before, but for the benefite and commoditie of thoſe, that are vnder theyr gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For if it ſhould chaunce, that vpon iuſt cauſe they were to be diſmiſt out of the Societie, according to the priuiledges thereof, they ſhoulde thereby receiue no wrong, but bee able to liue of themſelues: whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, beeing depriued thereof, they ſhould be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen eyther to begge, or to continue in the Societie, not onely to the hurt and preiudice thereof, but alſo to the endangering of their owne bodies, yea and theyr ſoules to.</p>
               <p>It is a nevve Lavve (you will ſay,) true. It is new and vvonderfull, ſayth the great Canoniſt <hi>Nauarre.</hi> It is a new Lawe, as alſo the ſimple vow of Chaſtitie is, which this Societie makes, vvhich hinders marriage to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and diſanuls it after it is contracted. But it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to be right, by beeing newe, as long as it is rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Prince and head of the Church, who made
<pb facs="tcp:14558:113"/>the Lawes of other religious Orders, and the reſt of the Canon Law.</p>
               <p>The newnes of a thing, hinders not the nature of it. The newe Raiſins are Raiſins, as well as thoſe of the Vine that <hi>Noe</hi> planted. All right was nevve in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and yet ceaſt not thereby to be right. Sixteene hundred yeeres hence, this will bee more auncient then the Canons of the Apoſtles are at this day, which were as young fifteene hundred yeeres a goe, as this is now. The other lye, which is alſo refuted by this diſcourſe, is, that the Ieſuits caſt men off, when they are ſpent with trauaile. For as they are not retayned for hope of theyr goods, ſo are they not caſt off by reaſon of theyr pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but for ſome other iuſt cauſe. Otherwiſe, at the laſt, they muſt needes diſmiſſe all that make profeſsion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are depriued of all their goods; and they ſhould receiue none that is not rich, neither of which they doe.</p>
               <p>If there be any of ſo obſtinate a nature, that he wil not be amended, after that he hath beene lookt to, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicind a long time, it is reaſon that hee ſhould beare the puniſhment of his ſtubbornneſſe, and that the ſocietie ſhould vſe their right. VVhich notwithſtanding is not done but very ſildome, and that by the authoritie of the Generall onelie, and almoſt alwaies with the liking of them that are diſmiſt: whom we haue not ſo much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied, as endured, and waited for their amendment, 10. and ſometimes 20. yeeres. With ſuch griefe of hart doe they vſe this remedie; and ſo deerely loue they the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of thoſe that are damageable to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſo it is plaine, that you are in all things altogether vniuſt to the Ieſuits, in ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſeduce men, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into their ſociety, &amp; diſmiſsing them out again.</p>
               <p>Some man more ſcrupulous,<note place="margin">Chap. 51.</note> &amp; of better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then you, will demaund, vvith what conſcience they can be diſmiſt and abſolued, that haue once made
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14558:113"/>vow of religion, ſince the vow is a bond to God, which he onely can releaſe, as a right belonging properly to him. To that I aunſwere, that a vow binds, according to his intent that makes it. If any make a vow to faſt after the order of the Chartehouſe Munks, he binds himſelfe to faſt, as the Charterhouſe Munks do, not as one of an other order, who obſerueth no ſuch faſt. They that make vowes in this Societie, make them according to the intent and faſhion thereof; the intent is, that they ſhould be in ſuch ſort bound to abide in it, as that, when there ſhall be any iuſt occaſion, they may be diſmiſt, and acquited of their bond. Wherefore, hee that is bound, hath no wrong done him, if he be conſtrained to keepe his promiſe, or if hee be diſmiſt, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or will not doe his endeauour, to amend himſelfe and accompliſh it. For he hath made his vowe with ſuch a condition, <hi>&amp; volenti non fit iniuria:</hi> and he that forſakes the Societie without leaue, is an Apoſtata, and beares reproach, and the marke of his ſinne. But he that departs, by the aduiſe, or good pleaſure of his Generall, who thinks it meete, vpon ſome neceſſitie of minde or bodie, or of his parents, or for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good, or for ſome other iuſt cauſe, that hee ſhould be licenced to giue ouer, is thereby abſolued from his vowes.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14558:114"/>they would open their eies, and euerie one particularly examine his conſcience, for the good of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world. With whom haue I here to do? with the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; who making aunſwer to <hi>Arnaults</hi> Plea, would haue thought they had wrongd their holineſſes, if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary ſimplicity of others, they had intitled their diſcourſe thus, <hi>A defence against</hi> Arnaults <hi>Plea;</hi> but with a proud title, they haue ſet on the front of their booke. <hi>The truth defended for the Catholik religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the Ieſuits cauſe, againſt the Plea of</hi> Anthony Arnault. I take them at their word, &amp; wil labour for the Catholike religion with them: there is nothing more commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs by God &amp; his Church, then the performance of our vowes. I ſhould abuſe both the time &amp; my pen, if I would proue this by texts out of the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and by the authorities of the auncient Doctors of the Church, ſith deuotion firſt brought into our Church, the orders of Religious Monaſteries, by which wee enter the three ſubſtantiall vowes of Pouertie, Chaſtitie, and Obedience. This rule hath beene ſo ſtrictly obſerued, that the Pope himſelfe, though hee haue fulneſſe of power ouer our conſciences, yet neuer gaue liberty to himſelfe, to diſpenſe wholly with a religious perſon; vnleſſe it be in fauour of ſome ſoueraigne Prince, for the ſuccouring of ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vrgent neceſſitie in his eſtate. And our Lord being deſirous to ſhew, that ſuch diſpenſations pleaſe him not, ſometimes interpoſes the rigour of iuſtice verie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly. That was ſeene long ſince in the Realme of Naples, where, when all the royall line was ended in <hi>Conſtance,</hi> who had beene a long time a profeſſed Nun, the publique neceſſity ſeemed to claime, that ſhe ſhould be diſuayld, that the blood royall might be renewed by her. She was abſolued from her vow by the holy Sea, and preſently married to the Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond, of which marriage, <hi>Manfrey</hi> was borne, and of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14558:114"/>him <hi>Conradin.</hi> But neuer marriage brought greater ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine to Italy then this: becauſe the Pope and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour were thereby in continuall diuiſions vnder the names of the Guelfes and Gibbilins, which laſted an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite while. And as for the children that came thereof, <hi>Manfrey</hi> was ſlaine in a pitcht field, &amp; afterward, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin</hi> his ſonne taken by <hi>Charles</hi> of Aniow, king of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who cauſd him to be beheaded vpon a ſcaffold. I haue purpoſely toucht this example, to ſhew how little God likes theſe vnmunkings, what authoritie ſoeuer he haue giuen to our holy father the Pope: who alſo hath beene drawne thereto with an infinite number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, before be yeeld. But aboue all, it is a generall rule in Rome, that in all other families not ſoueraigne, the Pope neuer makes a religious man lay, but only chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the rigour of the firſt vow, into an other more eaſie to beare; as we ſaw of late in this our country of France. When as the Lord of Bouchage, comming of a verie noble houſe, had made himſelfe a Capuchin, and that after the death of all his bretheren, the neceſſitie of the time ſeemnig to call him again to worldly affairs, all that his friends could obtaine at Rome, was, the chaunging of his vow into that of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of Ieruſalem. It was neuer permitted, a religious man in our Church, that had made the vowe of pouertie, to ſucceed his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: much leſſe to be releaſt out of his Monaſterie to enter againe into a ſecular life. The Pope giues not himſelfe this libertie.</p>
               <p>And ſhall wee ſuffer in our Church, a religious Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit to ſucceed, and his Generall to giue him leaue to doo ſo, when it pleaſeth him? <hi>Dij talem terris auertite poſtem.</hi> This is no priuiledge, this is a new monſter,<note place="margin">Montaig. ca. 50. &amp; 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In which yeere, you obtaind permiſſion for the time, to come, not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that which was paſt: ſo that it came too late, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that died before. In the meane while, we haue theſe for Maiſters, &amp; Lecturers of our youth in their Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for holy fathers, &amp; Diuines in our Church, to preach to vs. And yet, as profeſt heretiques, in ſteed of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing againe our afflicted religion, by eſtabliſhing their owne greatnes, they haue wholy ouerthrowne ours alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither: and haue had no other foundation of their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, but their owne deteſtable couetouſnes.</p>
               <p>This indeed might haue beene obiected againſt vs heretofore (will the Ieſuit ſay) but not now, by reaſon of this new Bull. This anſwere at the firſt ſight may ſeeme verie ſufficient to ſtop our mouthes: but when you ſhall vnderſtand how, at what time, and by what cunning it was gotten, you ſhall find nothing in it, but ſauours of a Ieſuit. They haue diuers vowes, but I find none ſo ſolemne, as that which I will preſently declare to you; which is, to put in execution their deuiſes, be they good or euill, of their own priuate authoritie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect had of the holy Sea: and when they haue a long time vſed this verie ill, they ſpy out occaſions of troubles for the authorizing of that their practiſe, as men moſt neceſſarie for the maintenaunce of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<pb facs="tcp:14558:116"/>By doing wherof, they giue law to him, of whom they make ſhew to receiue law. The fiſherman fiſhes in a troubled water, and the Ieſuit in our troubles. In this ſort began their Societie, and after many refuſals, was confirmed by Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third in the yeeres 1540. and 43. in conſideration of the troubles that were at that time in Germanie, betwixt the Catholiques and the Lutherans. In this ſort they obtained of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, their great priuiledge, to diſturbe the ancient diſcipline of all Vniuerſities, in the yeere 1561. That is to ſay, when the troubles began to riſe in Fraunce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Catholique and Hugonot. The fame was practiſed by them in 84. when father <hi>Claudius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> their Prouinciall of France, ſtirred the humours of Rome, not only againſt the Hugonots, but alſo againſt the moſt Catholik King deceaſed, as if he had fauoured them. And feeding Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> with an infinite ſort of vaine hopes, they thought they might without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger pull of their maske, and get that approued by him, which they neuer durſt diſcouer to any Pope before, namely, the diſhoneſtie of their ſimple vow. In ſuch ſort, that in Iune 1584. they obtaynd the confirmation of this vow, and fiue moneths after, the deceaſed King <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, who wanted not his ſpies, made a Commiſſion to be publiſht in open Parliament, againſt them that practiſed any league in ſtraunge countries. If there were nothing but the oppoſition of this time, it were ſufficient to deface the memorie of that Bull of Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and alſo many decretals of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, which was a profeſt enemie to Fraunce.</p>

Out of theſe two Articles you may gather; Firſt, that it is permitted to the General to abſolue his religious from their ſimple vow, whenſoeuer it pleaſe him, and to ſend him backe to his owne houſe, freed and acquitted from his vow. Secondly, that this religious man, may poſſeſſe te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall goods, which clauſe they haue ſtretched to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, as you ſee in <hi>Montaignes.</hi> Thirdly, that ſince the beginning of their order, they haue vſed to do ſo. And laſtly, that <hi>Gregory</hi> hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmd theſe two priuiledges to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to the grants that before were made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; their conſtitutions. I wil make this controuerſie very plaine. Let vs run ouer the Buls, that they had obtained before, there is not any one wherein you ſhall finde, that their Generall was permitted, to diſmiſſe them, when he would, or they to inherit during their ſimple vow. There are 23. of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thoſe of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 3. 1540. 43.45.46.49. Thoſe of <hi>Iulius</hi> his ſucceſſor, 50. &amp; 52. of <hi>Pius</hi> 4.61. of <hi>Pius</hi> 5.65.68.71. in March &amp; Iuly, of <hi>Gregory</hi> 13.72.73.75. in Ianuary &amp; May 76. in February, Iuly, October December 78. in Ianuary &amp; May. There is no mention in any of theſe, either for diſtinguiſhing, or for inheriting or poſſeſſing of goods. All theſe Buls haue beene printed by them, in one volume, that of 84. is inſerted at large in the ſummary of Buls, gathered by <hi>Mathew Toſcan</hi> and in <hi>Ribadiner,</hi> in the third booke of <hi>Ignace</hi> life, Chap. 23. If they pretend that they haue any other, let them ſhew them, becauſe, where none are ſhewen, it is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med there are none. If I haue proued as I haue, that in all the former Buls, there is neuer a word ſpoken of theſe two priuiledges, the truth is, that by theſe laſt Buls, they haue circumuented the religious care of the holy Sea: as they did before, in the yeere, 1561. when to diſturbe all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14558:117"/>the auncient cuſtomes of the Vniuerſities, they gaue Pope <hi>Pius</hi> to vnderſtand, that, that which hee granted them, was but a confirmation of a grant made to them by <hi>Iulius</hi> the 3.

But Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> put in his permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not onely in conſideration of theſe conſtitutions; but of the former Apoſtolique graunts, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot be found.

               <p>I acknowledge alſo, that, as for this poynt, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, when they entred into the courſe of Ieſuitiſme, were not ignorant of it: For 4. or 5. dayes after that the Nouice entreth into the houſe of Nouiceſhip, there to accompliſh his two yeeres of probation,<note place="margin">Conſt. part. 3. c. 4. art. 5.</note> the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are charged to deliuer to him all their letters Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick, theyr Statuts, and Conſtitutions; yea, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall examination that is to be made of him: to the end, that hee may informe him ſelfe of the weight of the burden bee muſt beare, vvhen hee ſhall bee admitted into this Order. and that hee may not haue any ground to repent himſelfe afterward. Now ſith it may be found by their conſtitutions, that theyr Generall is permitted to abſolue the religious from theyr ſimple vow, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he will, and ſith theſe conſtitutions are imparted to them, it cannot be ſayd, that they are ignorant of this priuiledge of their General; and a man may ſay of them in this regard, as the Ieſuit <hi>Montaignes</hi> doth <hi>volenti non fit imuriac</hi> if ſo be that this permiſſion be lawfull to be admitted into our Chriſtian Church, and that <hi>Gregorie</hi>

And becauſe that perhaps may require a more preciſe explication they expreſſe it at large in the 4. c. of their generall Examination, where they enioyne them, as I ſaid ere-while, to diſpoſe, not onely of the goods that they haue in poſſeſſion, but alſo of thoſe, which they haue no otherwiſe but in hope. <hi>Debent omnia bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the concluſion of all this, they haue no ſooner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned all their goods, during the firſt yeere of theyr
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14558:118"/>Nouiceſhip, but that they are permitted, after their vow of pouertie, to be heyres vnto them whom they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to forget, yea the loue and memory of them. Therefore I conclude, that this priuiledge, for him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite that hath made the vow of Pouertie, is firſt againſt the holy decrees of God, and of his Church. Secondly, againſt common ſence. Thirdly, grounded vppon two inexcuſable and very manifeſt lyes, The one, when it is ſuppoſed by the Bull, that their Conſtitutions permit them to inherit, during theyr Simple vow, The other, when according thereto, they giue their Nouices to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that they may inherit after they haue made the ſimple vow. For contrariwiſe, all theyr Conſtitutions gaine-ſay it in very plaine termes. Turne therefore and wind this Bul of <hi>Gregory</hi> which way you wil, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, that engages the holy Sea in fauour of them.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe freely, that when the Ieſuit <hi>Montaignes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, that the Prince &amp; head of the Church, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them this vnhappy vowe, I beganne to tremble, weighing with my ſelfe, of what conſequence this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was to all Chriſtendome: but when I had ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my ſelfe by reading the Bull, ô impudent coozners, (quoth I then) who draw in the holy Sea for warrant of your impietie. Did euer any man ſet the popedom for a fairer mark then this, againſt our aduerſaries? I would not wiſh any other thing in their hands then this, to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer vs, if it were true. This is the charitie that you honeſt men, which preach nothing but charitie, ſhew, to the deſolation of the holy Sea, of which you make ſhew to be the only Protectors. And yet, if Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> had otherwiſe made this grant, then to gratifie you at that time, when you promiſt nothing leſſe, then to giue Lawes to all ſoueraigne Princes, and to the Pope himſelfe, I would not ſeeke to preuaile againſt his Bull, eyther by the auncient liberties of our famous Church of Fraunce, which cannot beare in Fraunce
<pb facs="tcp:14558:119"/>ſuch extraordinary permiſsions, or by the maieſty of our Kings, the Defenders of our liberties, or by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our Parliaments vnder them, to which the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline appertaines. And much leſſe would I aduiſe, to appeale to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell to be held hereafter, as our ancient French were wont to doe in ſuch affayres. Neither would I ſtir vp the faithfull care of all generall Proctors of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to appeale, as from abuſes, from the thundring of this Bull: which were the ſhorteſt way.</p>
               <p>God forbid that I ſhould furniſh the world with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents that might be preiudiciall to the holy Sea. But if this great Pope were aliue, I would caſt my ſelfe at his feete, and appeale from him to himſelfe, &amp; beſeech him in all humilitie, that it would pleaſe him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his abſolute power, he be able to make two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries agree in the ſame ſubiect; that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the law of God, a man ſhould lodge riches in pouertie: ſo that, in this article it ſhould ſeeme, that both Gods law, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſence is forgotten. I would farder beſeech him to conſider, whether it were his meaning to giue ſuch a permiſsion, as he giues not to himſelfe, and to graunt without exception, that thing to the Generall of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, in which the Popes neuer diſpence with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: and that without regard of the vow of Pouertie, Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; Obedience, to which the religious are bound, the Generall of their order, might abſolue them when it pleaſed him?</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I would ſhew him, that the Monaſticall vowes, which one makes to God, ought to be ſimple: but not according to the new learning of the Ieſuits, but to the auncient doctrine of Chriſtians. And that as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of old time in Rome, one paſt from one Familie to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other by adoption, it was to be pure, ſimple, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any condition; ſo by greater reaſon, when wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our carnall Fathers, to be adopted a new into the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14558:119"/>familie of our ſpirituall Father, the Father of Fathers, we ought to enter purely and ſimply, &amp; not to bring in the Foote-like craftines of the Ieſuits ſimple vow. Manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particularities I could ſhewe him, which I remit to the examination of our Diuinitie, both ſcholaſticall &amp; morrall. I will content my ſelfe onely for the preſent, to ſay, that all thoſe demonſtrations, ſhould be ſuperfluous, becauſe Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> neuer conſented to this vow, but was deceiued and coozned by the Ieſuits falſe informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereas nothing is ſo contrary to conſent as error.</p>

Let vs then conſider the reaſons, by which the Ieſuits would giue a paſport to the noueltie of theyr ſimple vow. <hi>Montaignes</hi> rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reaſon, for which it is permitted the Ieſuit reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to enherit and enioy goods, for all the vow of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie made by him, ſaith thus; Becauſe it may come to paſſe, that, after ten or twentie yeres, the Ieſuit that ſhall be found incorrigible, may be diſmiſt by the Generall of our Order, and beeing ſent home againe, wee are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſo to deale by chriſtian charity, that he may haue no occaſion to beg. Beſides, wee vſe not this chaſtiſement but very ſildome, and almoſt alwaies with the liking of them that are diſmiſt. And truly this is a very charitable reuenge.</p>
               <p>In other Orders of Religion, if any religious perſon behaue himſelfe diſorderly, ſometimes he is diſciplind openly in the Chapter-houſe, ſometimes he is made to faſt with bread &amp; water in a darke priſon, more or leſſe, according to his deſerts, that he may ſerue for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his Brethren. By ſo dooing, without ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the auncient vow of our Catholique religion, and making things ſcandalous; that is drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Munk
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14558:120"/>by rigour, which by faire meanes could not be obtaind. But in the holy order of the Ieſuits, in ſted of chaſtiſing their diſorderly religious, they are honeſtlie inuited to ill dooing, and to make themſelues incorrigible when they are wearie of ſtaying there; to the end, that theyr Generall may haue occaſion to ſend them home againe to their owne houſes, there to end theyr dayes, fat, fayre, and rich.</p>
               <p>What newe Idea of a Common-wealth or religion is this, ſith they ſeldome vſe this puniſhment, which I call a recompencing and reward of lewdnes? Is it meete to turne vpſide-downe the ancient conſtitutions of our Church, and to damne an infinite ſort of ſoules infected with this new fayth, to the end that three or foure lewd Ieſuits may liue at theyr caſe?</p>
               <p>Let vs ſpeake plaine, this is not the matter. For <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taignes</hi> himſelfe, acknowlegeth in the end of his chapter, that their Generall may ſend them home to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not onely when they haue offended, but vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie other occaſion. But hee (ſaith <hi>Montaignes</hi>) that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, with the aduiſe and good liking of his Generall, who thinks it meet, that for ſome neceſſitie of minde or body, or of his kindred, or of the publique good, or ſom other iuſt reaſon, hee ſhould be diſmiſt, is abſolued by this meanes from his vow. Whereby you may ſee, that it is not vnder the colourable pretence of chaſtizing them, that they are ſuffred to enter vppon inheritances, (which yet were a ridiculous and impious chaſtiſement) but to fauour their Generalls power, which is greater &amp; more abſolute, then euer the Popes was ouer the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church.</p>
               <p>But I pray forſooth, why doe not you practiſe that which other religious perſons doe, without innouating any thing in our Catholike, Romane Church? You would be very ſorry to doe ſo. It is not Chriſtian chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that leades you to that courſe, but Ieſuitiſh charitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of all the countries where you inhabite. I wil make it plaine, that both theſe are vndoubtedly found in this ſimple vow. You looke not after any thing but worldly goods, riches, &amp; poſſeſsions, though you make a ſhew to ayme at no other mrak but heauen: If you know that your Nouice, after his two yeres of probation are expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is capable of inheriting, vvherefore doe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure him with ſuch circumſtances and deuiſes during his Nouiceſhip, to giue away his goods before hee be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſimple vowe? Surely, hee muſt needes be a man of weake capacitie, that will not imagin, that after this firſt aſſay, when you haue made him (for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe) diſpoſſeſſe himſelfe of his goods, before hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one of your Order, you holde him ſtill in a leaſe, tenne, twentie, or thirtie yeeres: that is to ſay, ſo long as there is any likeli-hood of his comming to any inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that afterward, when all hope of his inheritance fayles, you may make him enter into the ſecond vowe, which is your firſt ſolemne vowe: which beeing once made, hee may not afterward poſſeſſe any temporall goods, nor be diſmiſt by his Generall, though he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo incorrigible; and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time forward, you take ſuch courſes with him, as they doe in other Monaſteries with their religious perſons that offend.</p>
               <p>But before he make this vow, the goods muſt eyther fal to him that firſt catcheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the Ieſuit muſt again diſpoſe of them to the benefit of the poore. I leaue it to you Gentlemen, to thinke who ſhall be theſe poore. For, if before he was taken in their nets, hee could not rid himſelfe, without gratifying them with his goods, what may one hope for of him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is intangled, but the ſame liberalitie? As if it were to be preſumed, that hauing beene brought vp a long time in the midſt of them, and farder, beeing deſirous to marry himſelfe to

               <p>But why is the Ieſuit during this ſimple vow, kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his kinred, why is he ſent out of one countrey into another, but to the end that if any new inheritance ſhould fall vnto him? no man might certainely know what his condition is, nor know how to call in queſtion the right he pretend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? Well, in the end he is freed from his vow, that he may be out of daunger of all empeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hindrances. Which done, he ſhall prooue himſelfe to be the right heire, and yet by a watch word betwixt him and them, he ſhall returne afterward to the Ieſuits, to beſtow his goods in almes vpon them. Adde hereunto, that this is a point, that toucheth the eſtate; that by this meanes it is eaſie for the Ieſuit to make himſelfe in time, maiſler and head of many Cities, Townes, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and Caſtles, according to the qualitie of them, whom he hath drawne vnto him. Let vs put caſe, that there are a doozen Gentlemen of good houſes, that haue made themſelues Ieſuits, and that ſome ciuill or forraigne warres, hath taken away all their brethren: who now, but the Ieſuits of the ſimple vow ſhall ſucceed in their inheritance, and ſo being admitted to their firſt ſolemne vow, ſhall enrich their order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall?
<pb facs="tcp:14558:122"/>And in time they will become Monarches.</p>
               <p>But let vs leaue this point of goods: I am content that it be permitted their Generall to diſmiſſe them, and to beleeue that he will not enrich himſelfe with the ſpoiles of great houſes. See I pray you of what conſequence this diſmiſſing is, to ſend into the midſt of vs a man, that hath beene trained vp 10. or 20. yeeres, in the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie &amp; doctrine of the Ieſuits; or to ſpeake more truly, in their more then barbarous impieties, ſuch as that I will declare to you in their place. Is not this by indirect meanes to infect our countrey of Fraunce, as we ſee by the effect? For how many are there in this Realme, that onely by hauing beene their Schollers and Diſciples, foſter opinions, of murthers, maſſacres, watch-words, and rebellions againſt their Prince? What may you then looke for of them, that hauing bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I conclude, that this ſimple vow contains vnder it, Hereſie, Machiaueliſme, Cooznage, and aboue all, a groſſe deceiuing of the Sea Apoſtolique. All which, tend to the ruine of the Familes, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, where the Ieſuits inhabit.</p>

Let vs grant him this omnipotency ouer them of his order, which our holy Father the Pope, dooth not giue to himſelfe, ouer any other religious of our Catholique Church.

This man, being wearie of the hypocriſies, and other euill faſhions, which he ſaw raigned in all this Societie, not able to beare this water any longer in his ſtomacke, preſented himſelfe to Father <hi>Clement du Tuits,</hi> Prouici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Paris, and beſought him that he might be diſmiſt,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:123"/>becauſe it was not his intent to abide any longer with them. Father <hi>du Puits,</hi> perſwaded him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, ſhewing him, that although he had not made profeſſion by the great vow, yet hauing made the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vow, of Pouertie, Chaſtitie, and Obedience, he was bound to the keeping of that, ſo long as he liued there, as well as the religious of other Monaſteries; and that he might not go from it, without the conſent of his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. Hereto the Ieſuit replied. That he neither meant, nor would goe from it, of his owne authoritie, but that his Superiour might not denie him leaue, as long as hee requeſted it. That herein, there ought to be a mutuall conſent of will and power, and that as the Superiour might diſmiſſe the inferiour, without his liking, ſo the inferiour might compel the Superior to diſcharge him, though he were not well diſpoſed to do it: that their was as much irrigularitie in the the firſt propoſition, as in the ſecond, and that if there were iuſtice in the one, there was like in the other. This queſtion, ſurely was one of the hardeſt that belongs to their Societie, and if the obedience, that they all vow to their Generall, bee ſuch, as I will ſhew in this place, this doubt had need to to haue beene cleered by him, and his aſſiſtants.

If that vpon the importunitie of an inferiour, he may diſmiſſe him, to the preiudice of the 3. religious &amp; ordinary vowes of all ſubſtantial orders, Pouertie, Chaſtitie, and Obedience?

<pb facs="tcp:14558:125"/>there ſhall be no reuenewes proper, eyther to be applied to the veſtrie, or to the frame and buildings, or for any other purpoſe whatſoeuer. That the Societie may haue nothing to diſpoſe of, but onely depend vpon God, whom by his grace they ſerue, truſting that without reuenewes he will prouide things neceſſarie for vs, to his praiſe and honour.</p>
               <p>They that are profeſſed (that is, men of the laſt great &amp; ſolemne vow) ſhal liue by almes in their houſes, when they are not ſent forth to any countrey, nor take the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie charge of Rectors of Colledges, or Vniuerſities, except it be vpon neceſſitie, or vrgent vtilitie require it, neither ſhall they vſe the Colledges reuenewes in their houſes.</p>
               <p>They ſhall be readie to begge from doore to doore, when obedience or neceſſitie requires it. And to this purpoſe let there be one, or two, or more appointed, to craue almes for the ſuſtenance of the Societie, which ſhal begge the almes ſimply: For the loue of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus.</p>
               <p>The houſes and Churches of the Societie ſhall not onely haue no rents, or reuenewes, but no poſſeſſions or inheritance, in generall or particular.</p>
               <p>Gather all theſe particulars together, was there euer pouertie more obſtinately vowed then this? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, that firſt <hi>Pius</hi> 5. and after <hi>Gregorie</hi> 13. or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that this Societie ſhould be placed among the orders of Mendicants. If they would obſerue that which heere is enioyned them, I would excuſe them with all my heart, of the hereſie of their firſt vow. And that, becauſe that after they had a long time enioyed goods, during the time of theyr ſimple vowe, at the laſt to make ſatisfaction to GOD for it, being come to the period of their great vow, by reaſon whereof, they haue the name of Fathers aboue the other religious, yet not onely they vow from thence forwards a beggery, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14558:125"/>ſo themſelues to become treaſurers thereof. I would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, as the true followers of S. <hi>Peters</hi> repentance, after he had denied his maiſter, &amp; would eſteeme them aboue all the other orders of Mendicants: But when ſaw you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goe with a wallet vp and down the towne? For all this they liue richly and plentifully, not with the Manna of God, (for they are not children of Iſrael) but by a notable poynt of Sophiſtrie, &amp; ſee how.<note place="margin">By the Bul of Pau. 3. 1540. and that of Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, 1550.</note> The hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, where theſe holy Fathers dwell, are not permitted to haue any goods, but onely their Colledges are.</p>
               <p>Nowe ſo it is, that vnder theyr Generalls authoritie, they haue all the care and gouernment of their Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Theſe are the old <hi>Cincinnati</hi> of Rome, that boſted they had no gold, but commaunded them that had. In like ſort theſe Maiſters, though they may haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reuenews but theyr wallet, yet doe they gouerne them that haue good ſtore.</p>
               <p>This foundation preſuppoſed, you may eaſily iudge what will follow. For it is reaſon, that being fathers, they ſhould be fed and maintained by their chyldren: and it is more honeſtie for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to aske almes of their Colledges where they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, then to ſtraggle vp &amp; downe the Townes to craue it. See howe carefully they make ſheaues of Fearne for God, as <hi>Caine</hi> did.

               <p>Well, among theſe matters, you ſee the Kitchen goes firſt. This was to teach his Diſciples, that in the houſe of godlines, which he was deſirous to build, aboue al things they muſt begin with the Kitchen: a leſſon which they haue learned, and obſerued very well. Nothing is more familiar to them by their Bulls and Conſtitutions, then beggerie, &amp; yet neuer had any men better skill to ſcrape vp coyne, that they might liue at their eaſe.

               <p>So that one may iuſtly call them, not the Order of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, but the ordure of Ieſuits: onely by taking one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the one word, and putting it to the other. For
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14558:126"/>although they make ſhewe, not to meddle with retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet they ſell by whole ſale the adminiſtration of the holy Sacrament, deerer then <hi>Gieſie, Elizeus</hi> man, would haue ſolde the ſpirituall gifts to <hi>Naaman.</hi> And I neuer read ſo braue a paſſage as this notable ſentence of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taignes</hi> the Ieſuit.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Eruſing ouer all the vowes of our Ieſuits, I found ſomething to be reprooued, as you haue perceiued by my former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſhall by that which followes in due place. But in the vow of Chaſtity, me thought there was nothing new: at the leaſt, I found no new thing, either in their Bulls, or in their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Yet, reading <hi>Montaignes</hi> in his 50. chapter of his booke called, <hi>Truth defended,</hi> I perceiue they haue a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:127"/>that is not yet come to the knowledge of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Sea, or of the Church, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſimple vow, which they vſed by the ſpace of fortie yeeres without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie lycence. For, ſee I pray you, what <hi>Montaignes</hi> ſaith when hee would excuſe the ſimple vowe. It is a newe Lawe, as well as the vow of Chaſtitie, which they of this Societie make, which hinders marriage not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and diſſolues it being contracted.</p>
               <p>Sith <hi>Montaignes</hi> affirmes it, I holde it for very true. For although it be not ſo thought, yet ſo it is, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this booke, the Prouinciall of Paris, was a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomleſſe Fountaine of the Ieſuits doctrine. At the firſt, I thought that his meaning had been, that after the vow of Chaſtitie made by them, none might marry, vnder paine of hauing his marriage diſanuld, and the children that ſhall come thereof, declared to be inceſtuous: But afterward, when I had bethought my ſelfe, that this law was not new, but very ancient, and that this Ieſuit calld their vow of Chaſtitie a newe one, by which, marriages alreadie made were diſſolued and diſanuld, I aſſured my ſelfe, that by this new vow, a married man becomming a Ieſuit, breakes the holy bond of mariage, which cannot be diſſolued but by naturall death.</p>
               <p>VVas there euer any hereſie more preiudiciall to Chriſtendome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this? It is Gods law, that they which are married by him, that is to ſay by his Church, may not be ſeuerd &amp; put a ſunder by man, except in the caſe of adulterie. Which ordinaunce hath been ſo ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in all times of old, that when the woman for her fault, is ſhut vp in a Monaſterie, though there bee no fault at all on her husbands part, yet is it not permitted him to marry againe, in our Catho. Apoſtlick Romane Church, but he muſt beare his part of penaunce, for the ſinne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by his wife. So hath our Church thought theſe two bodies indiuiſible. I wot well, that ſom think, that the wife beeing conuinced of adulterie in court of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14558:127"/>iuſtice, the husband may marry another wife: But in whether of the two is there greater error, them that ſo thinke, or the Ieſuit? They cleauing onely to the letter, imagine, that God hath giuen libertie to marry againe, becauſe that in all other caſes, ſaue adulterie, he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the ſeuering of man &amp; wife: &amp; yet the Church neuer thought, that the breach of mariage was intended in theſe words; for marriage is a Sacrament that cannot be diſſolued but by death: onely there may be a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bodies. Wherein the Auncients were ſo reſolute, that they thought, ſome, as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> vppon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, ſome, as <hi>Ierome,</hi> vppon counſaile, that neither of the married parties, might make any ſecond marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, as if their marriage had not beene diſſolued by the death of the former wife or husband.</p>
               <p>I ſpeake this, not to approoue their oppinions, for <hi>Tertullians</hi> was condemned by the Church, and <hi>Ieroms</hi> contrould by many great perſonages: but to ſhew you, that at the leaſt, as long as we liue, the ſacrament of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage may not be diſſolued, no not for adulterie. What new monſter then is that, which our Ieſuits bring into the Church, that he which becomes one of theyr order, may breake off his marriage, without ſinning thereby againſt his wife? So that vppon a bare diſcontentment of the husband, the poore deſolate wife ſhall remaine vnmarried, according to the lawes of Ieſuitiſme, &amp; yet may not marry another husband, becauſe the Lawes of Chriſtianitie forbids it. I haue heard it ſaid of other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders &amp; Monaſteries, that it hath faln out ſometimes, that ſome intemperate and ill aduiſed men, haue become Munks, rather by deſpaire then deuotion, becauſe they could not obtaine that folly which they ſought for of theyr Miſtreſſes; but to the breach of marriage, ſaue for adulterie, vppon the onely diſcontentment of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, poſſeſſed with a ſottiſh deuotion, there neuer was any that opend a gappe, but the Ieſuits, men without
<pb facs="tcp:14558:128"/>Chriſt ſince firſt our Chriſtian Religion began. If they ſo much abhorre marriage, whence comes it, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing attaind to their laſt vow, they call themſelues Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? A title indeed not ſo arrogant as that of Ieſuit, but yet full of ambition &amp; pride. At the leaſt I am ſure, that S. <hi>Ierome</hi> would not haue thought well of it, who vpon the fourth to the Galathians, ſaith, that the word <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> ſignifieth Father in Hebrue, and that our Sauiour hath declared, that the name of Father, appertaines not to any but to GOD his Father, therefore it was not to be liked, that in ſome Monaſteries, there were that were called Abbats, or Fathers. I thinke his meaning was, to ſpeake to the heads of the Munks, which were calld Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats: what would he ſay now, if he ſhould ſee the Ieſuits of the great vow take this title of Fathers? For in other Orders, we call theyr Superiour, Abbat, as him whom the Religious perſons muſt acknowledge for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as for them, they are called Brothers, as if they were all his chyldren.</p>
               <p>This name, Father, appertaines not but to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall dignities of the Church, as Pope, Patriarck, and Abbat: and whereas euery Ieſuit of the great vow, takes it as his portion, they ſhewe thereby, that vnder the fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſimplicitie of theyr Friers weede, they couer meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous arrogancie. I know they will tell mee, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins, who ſeeme to be an order not to be reproued, doe the like: and I will aunſwere them, that this fault of the Capuchins, may not ſerue them for a warrant. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> the Cynick, making a ſhew of deſpiſing the world, was as proud as <hi>Plato,</hi> when he vaunted in his beggerie, that he trode <hi>Platos</hi> pride vnder his feete: and I will not ſay, that there is no ambition vnder a Capuchins gray patcht gowne. But yet there may be ſome excuſe for him: For hee among them, that firſt thought to bring ſom reformation into S. <hi>Fraunces</hi> order, meant to make them Munks like the good old Hermits, whom of old
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14558:128"/>they called Fathers. As in deede, when we reade theyr liues, we call them the liues of the Fathers; and when I ſee the Ieſuits beggerie brought to that paſſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins is, I ſhall eaſily be perſwaded to excuſe this title of Fathers in them. But a man may ſee in them, a verie manifeſt ambition; becauſe, that beeing not content to call themſelues ſo, they make the worde (Reuerend) to be added thereto, which belongs not to any but to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls and Biſhops. Looke vppon <hi>Bellarmins</hi> works, printed before hee was a Cardinall, for example, his booke of Pardons, their title is, <hi>R. P. Roberti Bellarmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, &amp;c.</hi> which is by abridgement, that which we call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend father.

               <p>And truly I am ſorry, for the loue I beare them, that they haue ſo ambitiouſly deſired this name of father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been a cauſe, that certaine curious fellowes, haue employed their time in writing Anagrams vppon theſe two wordes, <hi>SECTA IESVITAR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M,</hi> wherein they haue found matter of ſhame and reproch. As it fell out the other day, when I was in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany where there was ſpeech of that title which they haue taken, a good fellow ſaid, that there was no reaſon we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie them that title of fathers, ſith they tooke ſo good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſo. To which another replied, that it was not ſo, becauſe the conceit that ariſeth from theſe vvordes, <hi>SECTA IESVITAR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M,</hi> refutes that ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, whereunto he for his part gaue great credit.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all other orders, they that are admitted make three vowes. In this of <hi>Ignace</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall the good liking of Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third, that of Miſſion is added: not for his fellowes, but for them, which are of the laſt, and great vow. The words of their Buls are, that they promiſe without ſhifting, to go whether ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Pope ſhall commaund them. <hi>Ad profectum animarum &amp; fidei propagationem, ſiue miſerit nos ad Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, ſiue ad quoſcumque alios infideles, etiam in partibus quas Indias vocant, exiſtentes, &amp;c.</hi> He that cauſed the defence of the Colledge of Clairmont againſt the Vniuerſity of of Paris to be printed 1594. ſaith thus, ſpeaking of the greatnes and excellencie of his new vow. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants haue a particular vow of obedience to the Pope, but <hi>circa Miſſiones tantùm,</hi> which is grounded vpon this, that they being called by God to ayde the Church, and to defend it againſt the enemies thereof, ſuch as the Infidels and heretiques are, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be ſent abroad. And a little after: And they cannot be more rightly ſent then by him, that is ſet in Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> chaire, and gouerns the whole Church: who as the Pilot in the ſterne, ſticking to the helme, appoints ſome to the fore-ſhip, ſome to the ancor, ſome to the ſailes and tackles, and other, to other offices in the ſhip. Let vs dwell a little vppon this goodly ſentence, ere we paſſe any further.</p>
               <p>The firſt promiſe of this vow, is for the conuerſion of the Turks, which follow Mahometiſme, then, of all other infidels, yea euen of them that inhabit certaine
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14558:130"/>countries vnknowne to vs, which they call the Indies. I pray you tel me, if euer you vnderſtood that they went either to the country of the great Turke the Emperour of Conſtantinople, or of <hi>Sophy,</hi> the Emperour of Perſia, to acquit themſelues of this promiſe. They were neuer commaunded to goe thither by our holy Father, will ſome man ſay to me; I grant, becauſe thoſe places were too hot for them. Whither then haue they gone? Into thoſe countries that are farre from vs, <hi>quas Indias vocant,</hi> which <hi>Ignace</hi> cunningly added, as a thing harder to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, then the conuerſion of Turkie: and yet he knew, being a Spaniard, that nothing was ſo eaſie, as to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this charge, as you haue vnderſtood by me, when I recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to you the Embaſſages of the Ieſuits into Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,<note place="margin">Maff. lib. 2. chap. 10. Rib. lib. 2. chap. 16.</note> &amp; the Indies, which were vnder the ſubiection of <hi>Iohn</hi> the third, King of Portugall. Do yoe thinke, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that if it had pleaſed the Pope to ſend thither any of the foure orders of the Mendicants, they would haue drawne backe from this ſeruice, permitting them to goe in a ſecular habite, as the Ieſuit dooth? In ſteed of one <hi>Xauier,</hi> that was ſent thither by <hi>Ignace,</hi> there would haue beene found, 500. men full of deuotion and learning to performe this holy voiage. And why ſo? Becauſe it was a deuotion without daunger, for going thither vnder the banner of a Chriſtian king, who had power of life and death ouer them, whom by faire meanes he would bring to our Chriſtian Religion, it was a voyage without feare. But as for all Turky, which is vnder Princes, enemies to Chriſtianitie, I ſee not that eyther the Pope would giue them commaundement, or theſe worldly-wiſe Ieſuits be any thing haſtie to goe thither: and yet read the firſt bull, and it appeares that <hi>Ignace</hi> ſet downe the voyage of Turky, as the more eaſie to be vndertaken. I would to God it had come into the head of one of the Popes that ſucceeded <hi>Paule</hi> the third, to commaund our Ieſuits, to go to Conſtantinople, to
<pb facs="tcp:14558:131"/>conuert the Mahumetans, to trie in good earneſt wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> obedience they would yeeld to this vow of Miſſion we ſhould haue ſeene what miracles they would haue wrought there. Heare notwithſtanding, not a new Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, but a diſcourſer of his moſt humble ſupplication &amp; requeſt preſented to the king. We liue not vnder chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an princes only, but vnder heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tates, &amp; thoſe that are ignorant of the law &amp; feare of God. We haue Colled ges euen in Iappon, ſcituated to the Eaſt of our Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere; we haue to the Weſt, in Braſil, which is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of America: in Lima, &amp; Cucham, which is the end of Peru, and the vtmoſt part of the Weſt: in Mexico, which is in the middle of the two countries. To the Northward, we haue in Goa, a City &amp; country that lies by ⅔ as far from Iappon, as Iappon from Lisbon, ſome 6000. leagues. We haue Colledges in many places of the eaſt &amp; weſt Indies. That I may ſay nothing of thoſe we haue in Europe, which are a great many more then our enemies would, &amp; fewer by a great many then the godly &amp; zealous of our faith deſire. Beſides, the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of this Societie, without hauing Colledges prepared for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the conſeruation of Chriſtians, &amp; conuerſion of the heathen, frequent the countries of Mount Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, of Aegypt, of Africa, &amp; of China. When I read this paſſage with a friend of mine, I told him that this Ieſuit without name, played in the dark; and the verie lyer. As of old, <hi>Apollonius Tianneus</hi> the coozner did, alleaging to the Greekes for witneſſe of his miracles, the Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſophiſts, that were in India. Whereupon <hi>Aeneas Goſeus,</hi> in his, Theophraſt, ſaith, that it was not without reaſon, that this impudent coozner, tooke for warrant of his cooznages, them that were a farre of, and dwelt as it were in an other world. I ſaid, that our Ieſuits Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, did the like at this, day; who to feed vs with toyes, ſend vs to the ſame Indies, and other countries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſcarſe know the names. But at this word my
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14558:131"/>friend ſmiling, ſaid, that there was ſome <hi>Picrochole</hi> in their doing. What <hi>Picrochole</hi> (quoth I?) I think it is the name of a diuel, as <hi>Macrobe</hi> is. I perceiue, quoth he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that ye haue not ſtudied our <hi>Rabelais,</hi> who diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a great warre, that king <hi>Picrochole</hi> made vpon <hi>Grandgoſier,</hi> after that his fooliſh noule had reckned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try of France, which he took to be already conquered: his gallants that followed him, added therto; And moreouer, you ſhall aſſault, the kingdomes of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, of Hippo, Argier, of Bone, of Corode, &amp; valiantly all Barbarie. Paſſing further, you ſhall take into your hands, Maiorca, Minorca, Sardinia, Corfu, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iſlands of the Liguſtick and Balearick Sea: and in coaſting on the left hand, you ſhall beare rule ouer all Gallia Narbonenſis. Prouence, the Allobroges, Sion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Florence, Luca: you ſhall take Italy, euen Naples, Calabria, Apulia, and Sicill and ſacke them all, &amp; Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta to. Afterward, we will take Candy, Cyprus, Rhodes, and the Cyclades, &amp; we will ſet vpon Moria. It ſeemes that this wiſe foole <hi>Rabelais,</hi> meant then in the perſon of <hi>Picrochole,</hi> to paint out the imaginarie victories of our Ieſuits with their wallets, though they were not then hatcht. You are a merrie man (quoth I) but let vs leaue theſe trickes for the Ieſuit <hi>De la Fon:</hi> For I ſee nothing in this matter, but to laugh at. If the Ieſuit had taken <hi>Munſters</hi> Coſmography, he might haue added many other ſauage countries, and it had beene hard for vs to haue proued him a lier. I remember that the wiſe <hi>Tule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> ſeeing vpon a time the lawyer <hi>Balduin</hi> walking with <hi>Andrew Theuet</hi> the trauailer, ſaid, that they took no care to diſproue one with another; becauſe the one, had been alwaies in his chamber, wedded to his booke, and the other, had employed his whole time in trauaile, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking vpon a booke: That the one might quote many falſe authorities without being reproued, &amp; the other, name many countryes where he had neuer beene,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:132"/>without being contrould. The very ſame you ſhall find in this caſe of the Ieſuits we haue in hand. It is aboue 40. yeere ſince they bragd, that they had made theſe great conqueſts in the moſt part of thoſe countreyes. Their Statutes ordaine, that when their General is dead, all the fathers of our prouinces, that are in any eſtate or dignitie, muſt come to Rome, to proceed to the election of a new ſucceſſor. After the deceaſe of <hi>Ignace,</hi> in the yeere 1556. many came thither, where <hi>Iames Lainez</hi> was choſen, he dead, in the yeere 1565. <hi>Fraunces Borgia</hi> was choſen; in neither of theſe elections, though there was a great care had that the titles of all the fathers Prouincials might be ſent thither, yet I find not any one of thoſe farre countries: and yet the names and titles of all the fathers that were brought thither, were verie carefully ſet downe. They are bound to ſend letters to their Generall euery yeere from euerie Colledge, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him how their matters ſtand. I haue runne ouer all that were ſent to their Generall <hi>Aquauiua,</hi> in the yeere 1583. yet find no mention among them of any of theſe Colledges. It ſhould ſeeme their winning of ſoules hath beene meruailous great ſince that time.</p>
               <p>Let vs leaue things as they be, &amp; let vs not ſpeak vpon idle imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s but agreeable to common ſenſe: If they be ſcattred in ſo many barbarous countries, &amp; haue there conueried ſo many ſoules to our Chriſtian faith, they muſt needs haue had the gift of tongues to conuert the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is in the power of our holy Father, to ſend them into theſe vnknown countries, but not to beſtow vpon them the gift of tongues. That was a grace of the holy Ghoſt particularly reſerued for the Apoſtles, for the ſpreading of our Chriſtian faith. Conſider I pray you whether there be not likelihood of reaſon in that I ſay. Beſides, where are the ſauage Kings, Princes, &amp; Lords, which after their conuerſion, haue come to kiſſe the feet of the holy father to receiue his bleſſing? I vnderſtand that once in 60. yers
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14558:132"/>they haue had a Maske in Rome, of 3. beggers diſguiſd like kings, &amp; this is all. I place therfore their vow of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the chapter of money counted, but not receiued: It is a very cooze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>age, by which theſe honeſt felowes dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with vs. And yet this cooznage is nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that, whereby they abuſe our holy father. It muſt be granted by euery man, that he only and none but he, hath authority to ſend into heathen countries, for their conuerſion, ſo that no man in this caſe may be ioyned in commiſſion with him. But for all this, there is nothing, wherein the Ieſuits deſpiſe his authority more, then in this: the leaſt part of this Miſſion depends vpon the holy Sea, and the reſidue is in their Generall.<note place="margin">Bull of Paule the 3. the yeere 1549.</note>

From hence you may gather, that the Generall not only may ſend them, as well as the Pope, but, which is more, may alter, clippe, &amp; curtall the Popes letters Patents, as pleaſe him. Beſides, there are none but the fathers of the laſt vow, bound to the Pope in this Miſſion, &amp; they make account that the holy Sea is infinitely beholding to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for it. There Generall can do more. For he is permitted by their conſtitutions, to

It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him therfore, to ſend any of his inferiors, whether they haue made profeſſion of the vow or not, (whom he ſhal think meet) to any part of the world, for what time he pleaſe, prefixed or not prefixed, for any purpoſe, in which the Society is wont to be employed, for the good of their neighbours. It is lawfull for him alſo, to call home them that are ſent, and to doe in all things, as the ſhall thinke it moſt conuenient for Gods glory.</p>
               <p>I doe not thinke it ſtraunge, that their Generall may countermaund them that are ſent by the Pope, becauſe he had leaue to do it, by the Bull of 1549. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that point, which depends only vpon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, that the Generall may ſend whither he will, not only the fathers profeſt, but all other inferiors of his order, I cannot chooſe, but he greatly offended at the matter. For to grant ſuch libertie, is to giue too much to their Generall, and too little to our holy Father the Pope. Therfore, as oft as they trumpet out to vs this vow of Miſſion, by which their fathers of the great vow are bound to the holy Sea, they mocke both him, &amp; vs. For
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14558:133"/>this vow is ſuperfluous, their conſtitutions being ſuch for their Generall, as I haue ſhewed you. Of which conſtitutions alſo, they haue no Pope for warrant, and they are extraordinarily puniſhable for hauing vſurped this priuiledge vpon the holy Sea, of their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate authoritie.</p>

A ſubmiſſion, that firſt brought in a ſchiſſme into the Church, betwixt the popiſh Ieſuit, &amp; the true catholique French-man. Beſides, of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that if any quarrell ſhould happen betwixt the Popes &amp; our Kings, the Ieſuits would be as ſworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Crowne of Fraunce, as any that we foſter in Fraunce.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14558:134"/>And <hi>Montaignes</hi> in his book of the <hi>Truth defended,</hi> faith, that their vow is containd in theſe wordes of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,<note place="margin">Mont. c. 24.</note> after the three vowes of Religion, <hi>Inſuper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitto ſpecialem obedientiam ſummo Pontifici circa Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Which ſignifieth nothing els, but that they which are profeſt, promiſe to obey their holy father the Pope ſpecially, without delay or excuſe, to goe into any part of the world, to the Indies, or to the Turks, among the Infidels and heretiques to conuert them, or to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to ayde them.</p>

The words of the vow are. Further, I promiſe ſpeciall obedience to our holy Father, in the matter of Miſſion.</p>
               <p>This vow contains no other particular obligation, &amp; cannot be but commendable, in a time wherein there is ſo great need of good labourers, to ſuccor the church in danger.

What agreement is there of ſuch an antecedent, with ſuch a conſequent? Let the word Spayne goe. I will make no aduantage of it, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for or againſt the Ieſuit. Euery Prince playes his part vpon this great ſtage of the world, as well as he can for the aduauncement of his eſtate: A thing which is not vnſeemly for him, according to the rules of ſtate matters, which giue Princes leaue to loue treaſons, and hate Traytors.

And becauſe thoſe things which belong to the vow of Chaſtitie, need no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, for that it is certaine that it muſt be perfectly kept; namely, by labouring to imitate the puritie of Angels, in cleannes both of mind &amp; bodie. Theſe things graunted, we will ſpeake of Obedience, which all muſt labour ſtrictly to obſerue, and to excell therein <hi>And that not onely in thoſe things which they are bound,</hi> but in other alſo, though they ſaw no commaundement for it, but only a ſigne of your Superiours will. God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for whoſe ſake Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is performed to man, muſt alwaies be before their eies, and they muſt prouide, that they ſtil proceed in the ſpirit of loue, and not with perturbation of feare. So that all of vs with reſolute mindes, frame our ſelues in ſuch ſort, that we omit not any of that perfection, which by Gods grace we may attaine to, by the abſolute fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all the conſtitutions; and particularly, by fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our purpoſed intent, and that we bend our whole ſtrength to the performance of the vertue of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>First to the ſupreme Biſhop, and then to the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the Societie.</hi> So that we be readie at this call in all things, to which obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with charity maybe extended as if it were our Sauiour Chriſts owne voice, ſith he is in his place, and we yeeld obedience for loue &amp; reuerence of him: And ſuch muſt our care and obedience, as that if we haue begunne to make a letter, we ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:14558:136"/>leaue in the midſt of it, beeing called, and apply in the Lord, all our ſtrength and intention to obey. That our holy obedience may be perfit in euery part, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, in the will, and in the vnderſtanding; that with great haſt, ſpirituall ioy and perſeuerance, wee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh whatſoeuer ſhall be enioynd vs: perſwading our ſelues that all things are iuſt, denying by a certaine blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold obedience, all opinion and iudgement of our own to the contrarie; and this muſt be obſerud in all thinges which are decreed by our Superiour, where it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowne that there is ſome kind of ſin.</p>
               <p>And let euery one perſwade himſelfe, that all they which liue vnder obedience, ought to ſuffer themſelues to be carried and gouernd, according to the prouidence of GOD by their Superiours, euen as if they were dead carkaſſes, which ſuffer themſelues to be turned &amp; tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, how ſoeuer, and which way ſoeuer a man will: or as an old mans ſtaffe, which ſerues him that holds it in his hand, to whatſoeuer he will vſe it, where and how he liſt. For ſo muſt he, that is obedient, with cheerefulnes of mind execute, whatſoeuer his Superior will employ him in, to the benefit of all Religion. Aſſuring himſelfe, that he ſhall fulfill the wil of God better by that meanes, then by any other thing that he can doe, following his owne will and iudgement differing from it. Vpon this paſſage, the gloſſe hath theſe words.</p>
               <p>Obedience, concerning the execution of it, is then performed, when that which is commaunded, is done: concerning the will, when he that obeyes, wills the ſame thing that he doth which commaunds: concerning the vnderſtanding, when hee is of the ſame iudgment with him, and thinks that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, to be rightly commaunded. And that obedience is vnperfect, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in beſides the execution, there is not this conſent of the ſame will and iudgement betwixt him that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and him that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. Doe you not ſee, that the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14558:136"/>Ieſuits are impudent lyers, when they ſay, that their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vow to the Pope, is tied to nothing but Miſſion, and when they call them ſlaunderers that ſpeake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of it? For this which I haue here ſhewed you, makes it manifeſt, that they are bound to obedience, not onely in matters of their order which bindes them, but alſo in all other things; and that with as ſtraight and abſolute commaundement, as any poſſibly can be. But before whom are they lyers? Before the maieſty of their King: becauſe the humble ſupplication &amp; declaration before mentioned, was addreſt to him onely.</p>
               <p>The Ieſuit thinks he ſinnes not at all by lying impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently before his Kings face, yea, and confirming his lie with periutie, by laying his hand on the holy Goſpells. And why ſo? Becauſe, hauing receiued a commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his Generall to lie, his vow of obedience is ſo preciſe, that he thinks hee is freed from all ſin, and that hee had faulted much more, if by telling the truth, hee had not obeyed him. I cannot ſtay my ſelfe from being angry. For if this vowe of blindfold obedience be euill, howe is it that theſe wicked men obſerue it? If it be good, howe chaunce they diſclaime it, eſpecially, in ſo high a poynt, and of ſuch importance this is? As for my ſelfe, who meane to liue and die in that fayth, which at the day of my Baptiſme, my God-fathers and ſureties promiſed to God for me, I will neuer doubt to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelfe, in the midſt of all our aduerſaries, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, Apoſtolick Romane, as my predeceſſors haue beene.</p>
               <p>They muſt needes vnderſtand one thing in this theyr diſclaime, which I am conſtraind to tell them. Doe not think, that the Ieſuits are ſuch men as we are. They haue two ſoules in theyr bodies, the one, a Romane ſoule in Rome, the other, a French in Fraunce. That they may be welcome to Rome, they ſpeake there of nothing ſo much, as this abſolute obedience, in all things that may
<pb facs="tcp:14558:137"/>be commaunded them by the Pope. In Fraunce they flatly denie it, for feare of beeing baniſht from thence. For, that you may know how the caſe ſtands, our church of Fraunce, liues vnder the obedience of the Church of Rome, but with certaine liberties, by meanes whereof, it is preſeru'd againſt the practiſes of the court of Rome, as well in temporall things as ſpirituall. The Popes are men, made of ſuch parts as all other men are, ſo that in their holineſſes, there is ſomtimes a little of humane cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. If a Pope, wunne thereto by deuiſes, and falſe informations of them that are about him, ſhould make warre vppon our Kings, aſſure your ſelues, the Ieſuits would be as great enemies to them.</p>
               <p>The Pope ſmites with his principall ſword; which is his cenſures; a declaration of hereſie followes quicklie after them, &amp; then a publiſhing of the Croyſade. Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with this, the factions and preachings of the Ieſuits, and this vow of blindfold obedience, vnknowne to all antiquitie, and aſſure your ſelfe, this were to bring our Realme into a meruailous diſorder. Call to minde in what ſort Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth fayled to ſurprize the eſtate of Florence, from the houſe of <hi>Medices,</hi> where <hi>Iulian</hi> was ſlaine in the church as he was hearing Maſſe. Imagin how it had been poſſible for thoſe Lordes to haue ſaued themſelues from that vnlookt for conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, if there had beene a band of Ieſuits in their towne. Call to minde that which paſt of late memorie in thys Country of Fraunce, vnder Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, and how we were at the firſt afflicted, by his winking at and furthering our troubles. Both theſe had beene begging Fryers, and afterward became Popes.</p>
               <p>The one ſet himſelfe againſt the pettie Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Florence, but at ſuch time; when as yet there were no Ieſuits in the world. The other, led by the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits hand, was brought againſt the floriſhing Realme of Fraunce. You ſhall find, that it is not without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14558:137"/>that they diſclaime their Particular vow of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold obedience to the Popedome: becauſe they know in their conſciences, that no ſtate can euer be ſecure from the Popes anger, ſo long as they continue there.</p>

And this is that which <hi>Montaignes,</hi> one of our Order, alleaged ere-while by you, hath very wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aunſwered.</p>
               <p>You teach mee no new thing (quoth the Aduocate) and I would not haue fayld to tuch this ſtring, though you had not interrupted me. But it is wel, that you haue, had ſome pittie of men, that by this little pauſe, I might take my breath awhile. For indeed, to tel you the truth, I begin to wexe wearie, yet ere I make an end, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that this clauſe alleaged by you, is interla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For you gallants, neuer want ſhifts to couer your ſhame. Make theſe foure or fiue words, agree with the reſt of the article, and I will yeeld you the cauſe. Your vow conſtraines and bindes you to belieue, that when our holy Father the Pope, or your Superiours enioyne
<pb facs="tcp:14558:138"/>you any thing, though it bee not ſuch as by your Order is obligatorie, you are to thinke that GOD is in theyr mouthes, and that as ſoone as you are commaunded, in the twinckling of an eye, without gain-ſaying, all worke ſet apart, yea, if it be a Letter begun, you muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie obey. That in your obedience, you muſt bring the hand, the hart, &amp; the iudgement all together. That you are in this matter, as a dead carkaſſe, or a ſtaffe, which receiue no motion, but as they are thruſt by him that guides them; and to conclude, that the obedience, you muſt performe is blindfold. This in ſhort, in your vow, which you make a ſhew to limit by theſe words (ſo that a man find no apperance of ſin in it;) can it poſſibly be, that I ſhould iudge that he commaunds me any ſinne, in whom you will haue the preſence of God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in commaunding? Beſides, doe you giue me leaſure to thinke on it, though I might perhaps doe it, when as in the twinkling of an eye I muſt obey? More, you ordaine, that my will and iudgement aſſiſt the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this commaundement. Whereby you take from me all examination, meaning that I ſhould be like a ſtaffe in the hand of an old man. And for conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, this obedience, which you wil haue to be blindfold, ſhould haue eyes, if it were permitted me to ſettle my iudgement vpon the goodnes or badnes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. And indeed a man muſt haue neither eye nor iudgement, no more then you haue in your blind obedience; or elſe he muſt needs ſay, that theſe foure or fiue words, which haue beene foyſted by <hi>Ignace</hi> into this Article, are void, and to no purpoſe. If I had nothing but this to ſay, yet it were inough to make your Sophiſtry appear: but I wil not tarry in this broad way. It was <hi>Ignace</hi> that made this conſtitution. For <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badiner</hi> acknowledges; that all your conſtitutions came from him. There is not then any more faithfull inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of <hi>Ignace</hi> intent, then himſelfe. <hi>Peter Maffee,</hi> a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14558:138"/>Prieſt of your Societie, hath written his life, and that with the approbation of your Generall<hi>Aquauiua;</hi> for to him the booke is dedicated. I doe not thinke that he would haue ſuffered it to be printed, and much leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicated to him, if he had not thought that it made much for their order.

               <p>Hee alwaies ſhewed his care and obedience, by all
<pb facs="tcp:14558:139"/>means he could: He was at the Biſhop of Romes beck, to whom he was ſworne by an eſpeciall oath. When he was verie old, he went afoot on pilgrimage, whither ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it was needful, hauing nothing but his ſtaffe to reſt on. Neyther did he refuſe to goe by Sea, whenſoeuer the ſaid Biſhop commaunded him, though in a ſhip ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ill prouided. Which mind of his, when a certaine principall man miſlikt, as finding therein want of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; diſcretion, <hi>Ignace</hi> aunſwered, that wiſdom was not for him that muſt obey, but for him that commands. And as in our Societie he prefers this vertue before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo he was wont to ſay, that nothing was ſo contrary to the commendation of obedience, as delay, or rather arrogancie, in examining the reaſon of our Superiours commaundements, and he denied that he was worthie to be called obedient, that did not ſubmit both his wil, &amp; his Iudgement alſo, to his lawfull Superiour. For that, ſaid he, is a moſt acceptable Sacrifice to God, when all the powers of a mans mind, and eſpecially the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vnderſtanding, which are the moſt principall, are brought to the obedience of Chriſt. As for them that vnwillingly, and with miſlike performd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of their Superiour, onely in outward act, he made no more account of them, but as of moſt baſe Vaſſals, or rather brute beaſts. And a little after. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, he was wont to ſay in his common ſpeech, that they which brought onely a readie will, and nor a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their iudgement to the fulfilling of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours will, had but one foot within the cloyſter of their order.</p>
               <p>You ſee what obedience <hi>Ignace</hi> would haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, firſt to the Popes, &amp; then the ſuperiors of his order. Let vs gather the chiefe points of it. Behold a man, that hath one foot in the graue; he muſt go trauaile. Behold a broken Barke in the midſt of a tempeſtuous Sea this poore man muſt go aboord her, if the Pope command.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14558:139"/>God forbids mee very expreſly to be amurtherer of my ſelfe, vpon paine of euerlaſting damnation In theſe two commaundements, I ſee my death preſent before mine eies, was there euer any greater reaſon to ſay, that a man is not bound to obey? And yet by this obedience enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Ignace,</hi> not onely we are bound to obey, but if we doe not, we commit a great and grieuous ſinne. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and you ſinne againſt the expreſſe law of God. Refuſe to obey, and you ſinne againſt <hi>Ignace</hi> law, which the Ieſuits take to be greater then Gods. If <hi>Tertulian</hi> were reproued by our aunceſtors, becauſe he forbid a Chriſtian to flee from one Citie to another, to ſaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from perſecution for religion, as if therby he would haue vs become murtherers of our ſelues, what ſhal we at this day ſay of this cruell propoſition of <hi>Ignace?</hi> Once you ſee our Ieſuits are but mockers, when as to excuſe the impietie of their blind obedience they adde: <hi>There, where they diſcerne not that there is any ſinne.</hi> For <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> did not only not ſuffer them of his order to diſcern that there was any, but contrariwiſe, accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worſe then ſlaues or brute beaſts, if they withſtood that which was commaunded them. And that you may ſee better and better, what the intent of this great Law-giuer was, ſee what <hi>Maffee</hi> addes. <hi>Atque ad ſapientem hanc ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temque ſtultitiam caecae (vt ipſe aiebat) Obedientiae, ſuos vt eſſent ad ſubita &amp; ſeria promptiores, interdum etiam fictis in rebus erudiebat.</hi> And that they of his Order, might be the redier vpon a ſodaine in earneſt matters, by this wiſe and holy fooliſhnes of blind Obedience, as he called it, he did ſometimes put them to it in ieſt, by occaſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed for the nonce. And vpon this propoſition, he tels a tale, that one day a Prieſt of their Societie, being atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his. Veſtments, comming out of the Veſtrie with the Challice in his hand, as he went to ſay Maſſe, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a meſſage from <hi>Ignace</hi> to come to him preſently; The Ieſuit obeied him and left his Veſtments and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
<pb facs="tcp:14558:140"/>
                  <hi>Ignace</hi> askt him, if he did not miſlike this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. No (quoth he) I hold it for verie good, ſith it came from you. Know then, quoth <hi>Ignace,</hi> that I ſent not for thee, becauſe I had any thing to ſay to thee, but onely of purpoſe to make triall of thy obedience. And thou haſt done a more meritorious worke, in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacrifice thou waſt about to offer, then if thou hadſt offered it. So that although the Sacrament of the Altar of God, be of ſuch importance, as it is, yet Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is better then Sacrifice, as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Another time, as a Ieſuit prieſt was hearing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of a yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <hi>Ignace</hi> ſent for him, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when the Prieſt had anſwered, that he would not faile to come to him, as ſoon as he had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abſolution to the penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>Ignace</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this anſwer, ſent for him the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d time. Which this Confeſſor ſeeing, intreated the Gentleman to haue patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; went preſently to <hi>Ignace,</hi> who at the firſt word ſpake thus to him. What? Muſt I ſend twice for thee? And ſharpely rebukt the man with verie bitter words: not becauſe he had any thing for him to do, but to make him know, what obedience he muſt vſe in things that are ſeriouſly enioyned him. If he might haue entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an examination, and conſideration of the ſinne, the honour, dignitie, good order, and dutie to the Church, forbad theſe two Ieſuit Prieſts to obey their Generall. But he would not take this for payment, becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained not to the inferiour, to enter into conſideration, whether there were ſinne in the matter or no; neither is wiſedome to be lookt for, at his hands that is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but at his that commandeth. Theſe are then indeed very dallyings, theſe are mockeries, theſe are illuſions and fancies, by which the Ieſuit would abuſe vs, when hee alleages, that he is not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to obey, if he find any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of euill in the commandement. For contrariwiſe all ſinnes are couered, and blotted out, when he obeyes. This is that (Gentlemen) which I had to ſay this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14558:140"/>and becauſe after we haue fed our mindes with diſcourſe, it ſeemes to me high time to refreſh our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with ſome nouriſhment, I pray you hold me excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if I proceed no further: yet with proteſtation that after dinner I will declare to you at larg, all that ſeemes to me to be behind of this matter.</p>

But the Gentleman ſaid, If I be King in my houſe, as the Collier is in his, I appoint this afternoone be ſpent in walking, and eſpecially you particularly my good friend, quoth he, to the Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; are permitted to giue your thoughts leaue to play, till to morrow morning, when, if it pleaſe God, we will make an end of our diſcourſe. As he appointed, ſo it was done.</p>
               <p>Dinner was brought in, the cloth taken away, euerie man roſe vp to go whither it pleaſed him, into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, into the walks into the Parke, into the fields, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes or woods: For our hoſts houſe had all this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. For my part I went to the Ieſuit, whom I found reaſonable wel diſpoſed, after we had walkt two or three turnes togither. I ſaid to him; What thinke you of our Aduocate? For in my opinion, though much of his ſpeech were to verie good purpoſe, yet he went ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too far in reproaching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your order. It is not for me to iudge of him, quoth he. For if I ſay, he ſpake well, I ſhall wrong our Societie: if ill, you will thinke
<pb facs="tcp:14558:141"/>it is to flatter my felowes. In fine, which way ſo euer you take it, I may well be accepted againſt.</p>
               <p>Away with theſe points of Rhetorick (quoth I) you and I are heere in a place of truth, where wee are not to diſſemble. Do you not remember you haue read in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> that when the wiſe puts off her ſmock in bed, by her husband, ſhee puts of ſhame to? Sith you haue caſt off the habite of your Order. I ſuppoſe it is very eaſie for you to caſt off alſo that hypocriſie, which your il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers ſay lodges in your Houſes. You are a trauailer, and <hi>Homer</hi> could not tell how to repreſent the wiſedom of men better then in an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes,</hi> that had ſeene diuers Countries. Sith you were choſen by your Generall to paſſe from countrey to countrey, to ſound the diuerſity of our behauiours and opinions, that you might make report thereof to him, it is not likely, but that at one time or other, when you are alone in the fieldes, you vvill finde leyſure to play the Phyloſopher, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the carriage of your Societie. Therefore I harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pray you; tell me plainly and trulie, what your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of them, and withall, of this diſcourſe of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate. For although you are meruailouſly kept vnder by your Conſtitutions, yet your thoughts are free. The Law-maker of your Order, was not able to take any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for them.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid the Ieſuit, ſith you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iure me in ſo friendlie a manner, I ſhould be very diſcurteous if I ſhould not ſatisfie you. The Aduocate is too blame, but not ſo much as ſome man would thinke. If he haue ſpoken ill of our Societie, wee are the cauſe of it. No man is hurt but by himſelfe. The greateſt ſecret that I finde in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of religion, is, that the ſecret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of them be not made commonly knowne, &amp; that euerie religious perſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the profeſſion he makes, liues in peace of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. I ſee, that amongſt the olde Prieſts of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then law, greateſt account was made of the Druides, &amp;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14558:141"/>there was nothing that got them ſo much credit, as an auncient policie, of not leauing theyr doctrine in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but to keepe it ſecret, and deliuer it from hand to hand, by a long tradition from their aunceſters to their ſucceſſours. If wee had followed the wiſedome of our great and wiſe <hi>Ignatius,</hi> wee had neuer faln into this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience. For it was his opinion, that wee ſhould keepe our ſelues cloſe and hidden, ſo that the people might haue no knowledge of our gouernment. To the end, that our ceremonies, or to ſpeake better, our deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be ſeene of the people, but not read.</p>
               <p>Our enemies then ſpake of vs (if I may ſo ſay) but by geſſe. Now our Bulls and Conſtitutions are ſuffered to come to this and that mans handling, I doubt mee wee ſhall be vndone, and whereas many in former time ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured vs, heereafter they will abhorre vs. And this is a poynt wherein I can not ſufficiently praiſe our <hi>Ignatius</hi> his wiſedom. For although he had not onely deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſd, but put in practiſe his Conſtitutions for the gouernment of our Order, along while in his life time, yet would he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer publiſh them, neither came they abroad till after his death; namely, till after the aſſembly that wee held in Rome in the yeere 1558. We made account then, that we ſhewed our ſelues worthy men, but indeed, there was neuer any thing doone more fooliſhly, as the euent bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth witneſſe.</p>
               <p>He had beſides, another very wiſe rule, that he would neuer at any hand, ſuffer that any of our Order, ſhould ſet pen to paper to defend or iuſtifie vs when wee were accuſed. It may be he did it in Chriſtian charitie, it may be alſo in wordly wiſedom. <hi>Spreta</hi> (ſaith the wiſe <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) <hi>exoleſcum: Si iraſcare, agnita videntur.</hi> There neuer was any thing that ſeemed to be ſo preiudiciall to our Societie, as the cenſure of the Diuines of Paris, in the yeere 1554. Some whoſe fingers itcht at it, woulde needes haue aunſwered it, and thoſe of the moſt woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb facs="tcp:14558:142"/>and ſufficient of our Order, who perſwaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they ſhould get the better of them: But <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> more ſubtile and wiſe then they,<note place="margin">Rib. lib. 4. cap. 11.</note> forbad them very expreſly. And it is not to be doubted, but that by this aduiſe, he got more aduantage by ſilence, then all our blotters and ſcriblers of paper ſince, haue done by wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For it is certaine, that this cenſure by length of time, was buried in the graue of forgetfulnes, if we had not giuen occaſion to renew it, by puſhing as wel at the generall eſtate, as at ſome particuler men in Fraunce.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Ignace</hi> liued (as I told you) wee were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſet out our conceits lightly to the view of the world, how well ſo euer wee were perſwaded of them. Now adaies, there is none of our Societie ſo meane, but abuſeth both his pen and his wit, without conſidering what good or hurt may redound to the whole order by his writings. They pleaſe themſelues in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, by a certaine itching deſire to write, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward coſts vs deere, while they ſet abroch many falſe &amp; erroneous propoſitions, ſquared by the rule of their owne follies. And God wot, our ill-willers knowe too well how to make theyr aduantage of them.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Iohn Peter Maffee,</hi> firſt, in the yeere 1587. and after him, one <hi>Peter Ribadinere,</hi> in 1592. did ſet out the life of our good founder <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and <hi>Horace Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celline,</hi> the life of <hi>Fraunces Xauier,</hi> with ſo many flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, (I muſt needs ſay ſo to my great griefe) abſurdities, and contrarieties, that I aſſure my ſelfe, I ſhall ſee ſome man or other ere long, that is full of leyſure and ſpight, make an Anotomie thereof, to the diſgrace of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of thoſe two holy Fathers, and the confuſion of our Order. You may thinke he is as wiſe a Prieſt as our <hi>Emanuell Sa,</hi> who entiteld himſelfe Doctor of Diuinitie of our Societie, vvhen hee cauſed his Aphoriſmes of confeſſion to be printed, wherein he bragges hee had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourd fortie whole yeeres.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:14558:142"/>
               <p>How many Articles find you among them, that tend not to the deſolation of Kings &amp; kingdoms? If hee had beene as wiſe as our firſt Fathers, theſe had beene good leſſons to whiſper into the eares of theſe Idiots, that take vs to be the great Penitentiaries of the holy Sea, and to ſuch as ordinarily come to vs to confeſſe theyr great ſinnes: but by blowing abroade all theſe circumſtances of ſinnes ouer all his Booke, it teacheth vs, that this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuell Sa,</hi> hath labourd fortie whole yeres, to make all the world in the end perceiue, that hee is none of the wifeſt.</p>
               <p>As for our reuerend Father <hi>Robert Bellarmin,</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be a very ſufficient man, as one that by his writings, hath found meanes to purchaſe a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls hat. But I may ſay to you, as a thing too true, that he marrs our market in making his owne, as you may perceiue by his bookes of the <hi>Tranſlation of the Empire,</hi> &amp; <hi>Of the Indulgences of Rome.</hi> In the latter of which, he hath toucht many particulars, which concerne not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and for which he had need aske pardon of Kings &amp; Biſhops. It is not my meaning to offend him by thys ſpeech, but if euer he and I meete together alone, I will ſpeake two or three words to him in his eare, &amp; requeſt him to write a little more modeſtly heereafter, as I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelfe hee will doe, hauing now attayned to that which made him write ſo; were it not, that perhaps he hopes to be Pope one day. But I thinke him ſo wiſe, that hee will not tie his thoughts to ſuch an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. For the wiſe Conſiſtorie of Rome, will neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Ieſuit to come to that high degree of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for an infinite number of reaſons, which I had rather conceale then vtter.</p>

               <p>Thinke not ſo, (quoth I) to the Ieſuit, for when I ſpake with him of it, he aunſwered me thus. Sir, my good friend, this diſguiſed Ieſuit, is like one of the Shrouetueſday Maskers, who by the libertie of the day, carry blacking about them, with which they marke euery one that comes in their way; who ſhould be but a laughing-ſtocke to the people, if they would be angrie at it. My collections of Fraunce, amongſt which my Plea is, carrie their ſafe conduct in their faces; If a man will read them, they wil anſwer for me. If any man will not read them, let him come to me, &amp; I will anſwer for them. If any man of learning, finde any obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in them, I will thinke my ſelfe honoured by him, if it will pleaſe him, to let mee cleere the doubt to him. For in few words, I perſwade my ſelfe, that this Mountebank, thinking to accuſe me, accuſeth ſometime Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> ſometime Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> one while <hi>Lactantius Firmianus,</hi> an other while, Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> and venerable <hi>Bede:</hi> and which is more, their owne fellow <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whoſe authoritie is of greater worth with them, then Saint <hi>Pauls.</hi> It is a ſingular vertue that Ieſuits haue, that the further they goe, the more fooles thy proue.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue (ſaith the Aduocate) diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto you, touching the Ieſuits doctrine and theyr coggings, as alſo, how that obtayning theyr priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they haue maliciouſly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented the holy Sea Apoſtolick. But I haue reſerued this morning time, to treat of the affaires of the ſtate, which they haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to theyr doctrine, within which, (by meanes of their abounding pietie that raigneth amongſt them) they haue alſo intermingled that leſſon which we learne out of <hi>Machiauell,</hi> in his Treatiſe touching a Prince, &amp; in the Chapter of wickednes. For the murthers and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Kings &amp; Princes, are as common among them in their conſultations, as amongſt the moſt vvicked murtherers that are in the world. Beſides, they haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen themſelues libertie, to trouble thoſe Realmes and Kingdoms, wherein they haue once had anie footing.</p>
               <p>It may be euery one amongſt vs, will much meruaile at it, but if you will examine, (and that without paſſion)
<pb facs="tcp:14558:147"/>that blinde obedience which they vowe vnto this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, it ſhall be an eaſie matter for you, cleerely to ſee the truth thereof. And marke I pray you, that I doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, (vnto theyr Superiors,) becauſe, though they likewiſe vow the ſame vnto the Pope, yet it is not with ſo preciſe a declaration. And that it is ſo, you may well perceiue by this, that in the Article which yeſterday I read vnto you, they ſpeake but once of the Pope, and many times of their Superiours: So great a deſire had <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> (their firſt founder and Law-maker) to teach, how much this obedience ought to be eſteemed of, in regard of themſelues, and their owne reſpects.</p>
               <p>Concerning which poynt, I wil freely ſay thus much, that though in Fraunce wee admit not this particular o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Ieſuits towards the Pope, yet is it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon much more tollerable then the other. For in reſpect of my ſelfe, I will eaſily belieue this, that the opinions of theſe great Prelats, are ſo well ruled and grounded, that though one ſhould vow vnto them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he moſt exact obedience that can be, yet they would not abuſe it. Thoſe Prelats are the men (the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whereof, comming from meane place) which were for their vertues, merrits, and ſufficiencies, at the firſt made Biſhops, afterwards Cardinalls, and at the laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to that high throne of the ſupreme Paſtor. In ſo much that theyr faithfulnes, holines, great experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and auncientie, haue (as it ſhould ſeeme) drayned and dryed vp in them, all thoſe fooliſh paſſions, which commonly tranſport and carry vs away. But to ſpeake the truth, I cannot, I dare not, I will not giue the like iudgement, touching the Superiors of the Ieſuits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, in their Chapter of obedience, as I haue alreadie ſaid, after that they haue once mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Pope, they ſpeake of nothing but theyr Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14558:147"/>that is to ſay, of their Generall, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincials, their Rectors: for theſe are they, who eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of them in regard of their Order, beare the name of Superiours ouer others. And you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie heard, that by the obedience that the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our oweth them, they are enioyned to beleeue, that by their meanes, the commaundement floweth from Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, and that therefore they ought, euen at the twinkling of an eye, not onely to obey in ſuch things of their Order, as binde them, but in all others: yea, that without lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And this is the very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of this preſent chapter.</p>
               <p>A little after the death of <hi>Mary</hi> Queene of Scots, the late King of Spaine, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the Duke of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, (who was then Gouernour for him in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries) to ſend <hi>Robert Bruſe,</hi> a Gentleman of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to the Scottiſh King with Letters, in the which he promiſed him, men &amp; money enough, to reuenge him ſelfe, for the death of the Queene his Mother, vnto who he proteſted, that hee bare alwaies a ſinguler affection, becauſe ſhe had vowed, and ſo declared herſelfe, to the laſt gaſpe of her life, to be of our Catholique Religion: which affection, hee would continue to the King her
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14558:150"/>ſinne by ſucceſſiue right: but yet ſo, as hee ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to become the inheritour, of the vertues and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of that good and worthy Princeſſe.</p>
               <p>My purpoſe is not largely and by peece-meale, as me ſay, to meat and declare, howe this matter proceeded, though I haue good and faithfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Intelligences of it. This onely I will tell you, that the ſaid Gentleman, had at the ſame time, charge of certaine great ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for the fraight of threeſcore ſhipps, to the end, that they might firſt ſerue, for tranſporting of victualls and munitions into the Low-countries, and afterwards, for men of war, which the Spanyard reſolued to ſend into England, hoping that the Queene of England, ſhould be aſſaulted on both ſides.</p>
               <p>A ſhort time after <hi>Bruſes</hi> arriuall in Scotland (he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene all his young dayes brought vp and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the Ieſuits) there came thether, Father <hi>William Crichton,</hi> a Scottiſh man, who ſome-time had berne Rector of the Colledge of the Ieſuits at Lyons. And he was in the company of the Biſhop of Dumblaine, who was ſent by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5. to the King of Scotland, to make him offer of a marriage with the Infant of Spaine, ſo that hee would become a Catholique, and ioyne with them againſt the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Iohn Metellenus,</hi> ſet himſelfe againſt thys negotiation, and for ſundry good and weighty reaſons, councelled his Maiſter not to regard it. Inſomuch, that the Biſhop returned thence, without effecting any thing, leauing <hi>Crichton</hi> in Scotland, who ioyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with <hi>Bruſe,</hi> and was his companion.

Yea that, that murther, would neuer be thought good and lawfull, beeing committed in the midſt of a banquet, and in the Kings preſence, againſt whom the iniutie ſhould ſpecially be performed, as well by reaſon of the ſmall account they made of his Maieſtie, as for the ſlaughter they ſhould commit, vpon a perſon, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he entirely affected for his fidelitie and wiſedome. And that if he did this deede, they ſhould miniſter matter to the King, to exaſperate him againſt the Catholicks, as murtherous, infamous, and trayterous perſons to God and the world, who to that preſent houre, had receiued all bountifull kindneſſes &amp; curteſies from their King.</p>

The other, that he was a Traytor, becauſe he would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe money, to cauſe <hi>Metellenus</hi> to be ſlame and thys was the principall marke, at which the Accuſer aymed. A great fruit certainly in the Ieſuit common wealth, &amp; for which, hee was worthily kept priſones in Bruxells, full fourteene months together.

After this, hee tooke againe the way to Lions, where, diſcouering himſelfe to the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, he was greatly prayſed and honoured of them. A

The Engliſh man being thus perſwaded, tooke his leaue of them, and returned into England, fully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to bring his treaſon to effect and iſſue, whereunto the better to attaine, he ſought all the meanes he might, to kiſſe the Queenes Maieſties hand, ſaying that he had certaine things of verie great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> importance, to acquaint her withall. And this was about the moneth of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atie,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:154"/>in the yeere 1585. At the laſt, being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Maiſtie, he largely diſcourſed vnto her, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of his trauaile, and how, that counterfaiting the fugitiue, he had diſcouered all the practiſes and plots, that the Engliſh Catholiques had brewed or deuiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Maieſtie; yea, that he had promiſed them, that he would be the firſt that ſhould attempt her death, which had purchaſed him verie great credit amongſt them. And yet notwithſtanding, that he would rather chooſe a hundred deaths, then to defile his ſoule with ſo damnable at thought.</p>
               <p>He was a well ſpoken man, of a good countenaunce, &amp; ſuch a one, as had prepared himſelfe to play his part, not vpon the ſodaine, but wel prouided. The Queene (who wanteth not her ſpies) knew, that one part of that which he had ſpoken; was verie true; which alſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to credit the reſt: and graciouſly accepting of that honeſt libertie and freedome, which he pretended, charged him not to depart farre from the Court: and that in the meane ſeaſon, he ſhould by letters, ſound the affections of her enemies: which thing he promiſed, and vndertooke to do: and vpon this promiſe, feeding the Princeſſe with goodly ſhewes, he did many times talke verie priuately with her. And amongſt other, ſhe going one day to hunt the fallow Deere, he followed her, neuer ſuffering her out of his eye. At laſt, being a good way, from her owne people, and diſmounted from her horſe, to refreſh her ſelfe at the foote of a tree in the wood. <hi>Parry</hi> being nigh vnto her, twiſe had a deſire to kill her; but he was with-hold there-from, by that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous familiaritie which her Maieſtie vſed towards him. At another time, he walking after Supper with her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the garden of her Pallace; called white Hall, which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the Thames ſide, (where alſo be) had a boate readie, with the greater ſpeed to ſaue him; and to carrie him away, when he had giuen the blow, as alſo he ſought
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14558:154"/>opportunitie for it) the Queene eſcaped from him to this manner.</p>
               <p>He ſuppoſed, to draw her ſome-what farre from the the houſe, and that then he would kill her, at the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens end. But ſhe returned towards her Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, that it was time to betake her to her chamber, being troubled with heat, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was the next day, to take a bath by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of her Phiſitions: And thereupon laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe withall added, that they ſhould not drawe ſo much bloud from her, as many people deſired. And with this ſpeeth ſhe with drew her ſelfe, leaning <hi>Parrie</hi> much arnazed at this, namely, that hee had fayled, in that his ſo worthie an enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>Now as he behaued himſelfe after this manner about the Q. he ſuppoſed, that he wanted a truſty friend to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond him in his attempt, &amp; therupon he addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his friend <hi>Edmond Neuill,</hi> an Engliſh Gentleman, who for his Religion and conſcience ſake, had his part amongſt the afflictions &amp; troubles of England, whom alſo he diuers times viſited: and after that he had ſworne him vpon the Euangeliſtes, not to reueale or diſcouer that which he ſhould tell him, did particularly, and by peace-meale diſcourſe to him, his whole intention, &amp; prouoked him to take part with him therein, as one that had great reaſon, liuely to feele the iniuries that had bin c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>CAAP. 5.</hi> ¶ That the Ieſuits doe at this day make ſhew to condemne their wicked doctrine, in all things concerning eyther the murthering of Princes, or rebellion against their States.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the comming of Iuſuits into our countrey, we knew not what it was, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmoth, as we ſay, to kill Kings and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes. This is a certaine kind of Merchandize and ware, that hath come out of their ſhips, by reaſon of that wicked vow of blind obedience, which they make to their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, Inſomuch, as Princes lawes depend at this day, vpon the good minde of theſe honeſt people. And though their profeſſion bee, as you haue heard, yet doe they at this day in their bookes diſaduance the ſame with many goodly ſpeeches, of which they are neuer without ſtore. And becauſe amongſt all manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and murthers, there is none more plaine and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then theſe that <hi>Barriere,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Chastell,</hi> meant to commit againſt our Kings, I will firſt deale with that of <hi>Barriere,</hi> concerning which <hi>Montaignes</hi> ſpeaking, ſaith that it was a deceit or coozning, and that the Ieſuits are altogether cleare of it.</p>
               <p>The truth is (ſaith he aunſwering <hi>Arnault</hi>) that <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere</hi> depoſed that he had asked councel of a Ieſuit,<note place="margin">Chap. 59. in his booke of Truth defended.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his purpoſe and practiſe, that is true indeed: for he came to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arade</hi> a Ieſuit of Paris, from whom, he was ſent away and ſharpely reproued: he declaring by his countenance and ſpeech, that he was ſo farre car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried againſt him in it, that hee would not heare it in confeſſion or ſhrift. This alſo is true (which you made no account to deliuer) that this man <hi>Barriere,</hi> asked aduice of all the world touching his enterprize, and that
<pb facs="tcp:14558:160"/>long time before he did it, cauſed to aſſemble at Lyons, the Diuines on the other ſide of Saon, there to haue their aduice therein, where there was not one Ieſuit preſent. Alſo, that in the Church of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in the ſame Citie, he cauſed his funerals on the ſecond day of Auguſt to be ſolemnly kept, leauing there his blacke ſcarfe, and armes, as the badges and pledges of the fore-pretended victory that would follow. Againe, that he depoſed, that a Ieſuit of Lyons, diſſwaded him from that enterpriſe. All which things declare in that act, the vanitie of this man, and the innocencie of them, whom thou haſt accuſed, with ſo cruell amplifications, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerations, all tending to manifeſt the ouer-running of of thy lying tongue. And though there were ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (as indeed there was not) and that it were as forcible againſt the Ieſuits, as any thing in the world could be, yet being wrung from them by torture and torments, it was not any matter of importance forcible, ſoundly to proue it.</p>
               <p>This Ieſuit <hi>Montaignes,</hi> denieth the fact: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe euerie villanous and foule fact, muſt be denied. And he reproueth <hi>Arnauld</hi> of lying, though in all that, which I haue alreadie laid downe out of him, there is not ſo much as one word of truth. Let vs goe forward to the ſentence of condemnation, which the ſecond Ieſuit giueth againſt his owne Order, in the verie humble petition which he preſented to the king.</p>
               <p>The ſecond crime (ſaith hee) concerning your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie in particular, is more tedious and troubleſome, and indeed had more need to be confuted, for to ſay that we are enemies to Kings and ſtates, without mentioning particular of ſpeciall poynts, is to forme a propoſition of too large a reach, and which cannot eaſily be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but to affirme it in the ſpeciall, will draw the point into a narrow roome. And therefore our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies haue endeuoured, to bring vs within the limits
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14558:160"/>and liſtes of the particular, ſaying, that we are the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of your Maieſty in particular, and of the ſtate. The generall porpoſition, would ſerue for hound and horne to ſet the game on foot: But the particular propoſition, would blow the fall of the Deere, and finiſh the chaſe. Sir, before in this place we declare our innocencie, we humbly beſeech your Maieſtie, that that which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die paſt, ſpecially if you hold an opinion, that you haue forgoteen and forgiuen it, may not be preiudiciall to our iuſtification.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Maieſtie to remember, the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere full of magnanimitie of one of your aunceſtors, which is in euerie mans mouth, by reaſon that it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be noted. It behooueth not a King of Fraunce to purſue the quarrels of a Duke of Orleans. Sir, you are no leſſe couragious then this King was, neither ſhall you haue leſſe praiſe, but rather greater, if you vouchſafe to ſay: it behooueth not the King of France to reuenge the quarrels of the King of Nauarre, nor the eldeſt ſonne of the Church, to be incenſed againſt all, by reaſon of one mans opinion repugnant to the ſame Church.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Maieſtie then, to ſhew vs that wonted fauour which you haue extended vnto all your ſubiects, and to burie in euerlaſting forgetfulnes, euery thing which hapned in that ſeaſon. May it pleaſe your Highnes, here to be informed, that we neuer intended any thing againſt your Royall perſon in perticular, as our aduerſaries haue ſought often times to prooue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, and yet could neuer doe it: And that amongſt all things whatſoeuer, which the Clergie, the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and others, haue done or ſaid, wee haue ſaid or done farre leſſe then they reported of vs vnto you; and that they alwaies carried a tange rather of a bad gloſſe, then of a true text in whatſoeuer they did or ſaid. For if they now dare at high noone, and in the bright Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
<pb facs="tcp:14558:161"/>of our peace, charge truth with a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions contrarie to truth indeed: what might they haue done then, when as amidſt all the rumours and foggie clouds of warre, lying had his full courſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out encounter? and where truth durſt not ſhew it ſelfe. For the time of warre, is the time of lying, ſaith the old prouerbe.</p>
               <p>If happily wee may obtaine that of your Maieſtie, we doe thereby obtaine the vpper hand, and the ſecond accuſation will be without force: for it hath nothing to vphold it from falling to the ground with the leaſt touch. For by what argument can they prooue, that we in particular are enemies againſt your Maieſtie? From what ſpring doe they meane this hatred muſt proceede? And from what premiſes doe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this concluſion? Is it by reaſon that you are a King? Why, our Societie honoureth Kings: and this is approued by witneſſes, by experience, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Is it becauſe that you are the eldeſt ſonne of the Church? We reſpect this qualitie as much, yea and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more then the firſt. Is it by reaſon that you are King of Fraunce? Fraunce is our natiue countrey, and you as King are our Father. Whom ſhall wee loue, if we loue not our Father and mother? Is it by reaſon that you are a worthie warrier, and Captayne of Kniges, and King of Captaynes? This vertue maketh it ſelfe at all times to be beloued both of frends and foes. Is it by reaſon that you are milde in your conuerſation, wiſe in your ſentences, free in your manners, ſtedfaſt in your promiſes, prompt in your actions, ready to labour, bold in daunger, forward in combat, moderate in vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, and in euery thing royall? Theſe qualities cannot ingender or bring forth hatred. but on the contrary, they are amiable in all, but admirable in the perſon of a King.</p>
               <p>This ſpeech was appropriated in particular, to the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14558:161"/>Kings owne royall perſon; and a little before, neere the ſame place, is another ſentence, by which this honeſt man the Ieſuit vpheld, that men had wronged them, in imputing vnto them, to haue as it were wraſtled againſt the ſtate. To theſe witneſſes, dread Soueraigne, we adde a ſecond argument taken from the cauſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we building, doe demaund, what true likelihoode there is in our profeſſion, that we ſhould bee ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Kings and of their States. Are wee ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the law of God, that we know not, that it is God that giueth them? that by him kings doe gouerne, and by him Legifers make and giue good lawes? That both the name &amp; action of a king is a right of patronage proper to the Diuine and Supreme Maieſtie? and that kings beare in their royaltie the image of God; and in this calling God willeth vs to obey them, to honour and ſerue them for the ſafetie of their perſons and the State. And if wee know theſe things, hauing both preached and written them, and againe doe preach and write them: how may it be that we haue ſo little conſcience, as to hate that, which we beleeue that God loueth: to diſpiſe that, which he alloweth; to deſtroy that which he maintaineth; to haue ſo little iudgement, as to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh one thing and doe another? Are we to be reputed religious? Nay, rather more heatheniſh then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelues, then Canibals and Mainelnes, who though they can do nothing, but ſhew hatred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, yet doe they notwithſtanding loue their Princes.</p>
               <p>I praiſe thoſe two ſentences, (Ieſuit be thou whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou art) and would to God, that thy ſoule were as cleane, as thy wit is fine, and as I perceiue thy words to be ſmoothly couched together. I cannot but loue thee, inſeeing thee draw to the life, the counterfait of thoſe ſingular and admirable vertues of ſoule &amp; bodie, which ſhine in our King: and with all I muſt honour thee, in ſeeing thee ſet out the picture of Obedience, which the
<pb facs="tcp:14558:162"/>ſubiect oweth vnto King. And ſure if thy heart and my penne agree, I know thou wilt condemne them all that would haue atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted any thing againſt the perſon of this great Prince, who hath not yet met with his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, as one who in martial proweſſe, hath far ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all others. Thou carrieſt too noble a mind (were it not that thou art a Ieſuit) to Iudge of it any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Go to now, I will ſhew thee, that all that which thy fellow hath ſaid, in his <hi>Truth defended,</hi> is but a ſtarke lie: for that which toucheth the deed of <hi>Barrier</hi> when he came to murther this king, whom thou ſo much exalteſt, was contriued by the expreſſe counſel of thy fellowes, &amp; copartners. Not only then, when he was but ſimply king of Nauarre, but ſince he was called to the Crowne of Fraunce, &amp; reduced into the boſome of our Catholique Apoſtolique and Romane Church. If againe I ſhew vnto thee, the generall rebellion of Fraunce, enterprized vnder the title of the holy League, which was firſt begun after conducted by your holy religious perſons, againſt one <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, King of Fraunce, one of the moſt Catholique kings that euer France enioyed, what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wilt thou paſſe againſt thy owne party? I remit it euen to thy owne conſcience, yea to the conſcience of any good Catholique, that is not a cloaked Ieſuit: Nay further I ſay, that theſe two parties, are the onely vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of your condemnation, and vpon them grounding my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I take vpon me directly to ſhew, that to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh you again in France, were great lack of iudgement &amp; experience. I wil therfore lay down theſe two points in order, and firſt I will begin with <hi>Barriere:</hi> afterwards with <hi>Chastell:</hi> then with the Vniuerſall reuolt, of the which you Ieſuits (take it amongſt you) were the firſt authors within this Realme.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will recite vnto you faithfully this hiſtorie of <hi>Barriere,</hi> and that you may beleeue mee, I will ſpeake it vpon perill of my goods, of my bodie, and of mine honour: for I haue learned it of a friend of mine whom I eſteem of as my ſelfe, which was then preſent at Melun, when this deed was done: and who ſpake twice vnto <hi>Barriere</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Lugoly</hi> his Iudge, who ſaw him executed to death, heard all that he maintained during the time of his tortures, vntill the laſt breathing of his life, who handled the knife of the which I will hereafter ſpeake, who ſince drew out the Copie of his triall, and who by poſts ſent it with ſpeed, by commaundement of the King, to make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly knowen through all this Realme; and laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawen forth, he made me partaker of a Copie thereof which I haue kept vnto my ſelfe: and thus it is.</p>
               <p>The King, hauing made peace with God, and truce with thoſe that were his enemies, tooke his progreſſe from the cittie of S. <hi>Denys,</hi> to come to Fountane-bleau, and as he entred Melun, hee was aduertiſed by <hi>Lodowic Brancaleon,</hi> an Italian Gentleman, vnto him vnknown, that a ſouldier departed purpoſely from Lyons to kill him: He told the King, that he had not onely ſeene the partie, but that he had drunke twice with him in the Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins Couent. And beſides he ſaid, that this man was of a tall ſtature, mightie and ſtrong of his ioynts: his
<pb facs="tcp:14558:163"/>beard was of an abrun cullour: hee had on a Spaniſh leather Ierkin, and a paire of Oringe-tawney culloured ſtockings vppon his leggs. The King not eaſily aſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, yet full of prudence, ſent for <hi>Lugoly,</hi> beeing then Lieftenant general of the long gownes in the Prouoſtie of the Altar. To whom when he had recited that which he had vnderſtood, commaunded him to make a priuie ſearch through the Cittie, for this man who had beene thus ſet forth and thus deſcribed vnto him.</p>
               <p>The ſame day, the reporter ſaw this fellow whom he looked for in the Kings houſe; but as hee was in the midſt of many people, ſo loſt hee the ſight of him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, as God would, to the end the partie ſhould be remitted vntill the next day. Which Traytor, hauing lodged in a Hamlet, a part of the ruinated ſuburbs of S. <hi>Liene,</hi> as hee would haue entred the Cittie by S. <hi>Iobs</hi> gate, he was taken vpon preſumption of the fore-ſaide marks. This was the 27. of Auguſt, 1593. <hi>Lugoly</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be put in priſon, where hee examined him: and finding him ſome. what variable, cauſed yrons to be put on his hands and feet, as the importance of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did require.</p>
               <p>Preſently after his departure. <hi>Anna Rouſſe</hi> the Iaylors wife, asked the priſoner what he would haue to dinner: He anſwered her, that he would neither eate nor drink, vnleſſe that hee might haue poyſon brought him. This aunſwere being well noted of the aſſiſtants, cauſed him more to be ſuſpected, and his actions more narrowly to be looked into. Amongſt the reſt, there was a Prieſt priſoner, called Maiſter <hi>Peter</hi> the Ermite, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the looſenes of the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> became a ſouldier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for the League, <hi>Barriere,</hi> hauing learned of him, that they were both of one Societie; acquainted himſelfe with him. So, after ſome conference the prieſt enquired of him if he had not a knife; the other think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haue met with his mate, aunſwered him yea, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14558:163"/>at that inſtant time drewe foorth from his hoſe a knife, whereof the making was thus, the blade thereof very ſtrong about two ynches neer vnto the handle, hauing a backe as other kniues haue, and the reſt of the knife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiue ynches long, di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>cut on both ſides like a two ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſword, the poynt was made in manner of a Barly corne, or poynard: the knife of a right murtherer, as one who would not fayle of his ſtroake. The Prieſt in a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling manner told him, it was a fit knife to payre nayles, but if it were ſeene it would be his death. <hi>Barriere</hi> now requeſted him to lay it vp for him, the which the other did promiſe him. But at the ſame inſtant, he ſent for <hi>Lugoly,</hi> vnto whom he diſcourſed what had hapned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweeene them, and deliuering the knife into his hands, <hi>Lugoly</hi> informed and examined the <hi>Iailors</hi> wife, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poyſon, the Prieſt touching the knife, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian Gentleman of that which had paſt at Lyons the 28. of Auguſt. The priſoner being diuers times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, you ſhall vnderſtand, that in all his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hee named himſelfe <hi>Peter Barriere, alias, La Barre,</hi> borne at Orleans: by his firſt trade, a Basket-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and ſince that, inticed by one Captaine <hi>De la Cour,</hi> being in a Ladies ſeruice, whom he forſook &amp; became a ſouldier of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of the Lord of <hi>Albigny,</hi> the ſpace of one whole yeere making warres for the League, vntil he was taken by the Lord <hi>De la Gueſt,</hi> Gouernour of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoire, where he remayned ſome certayne daies. And from the time that he ſerued this great Lady, he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to kill the king, eyther with knife or piſtoll, in the midſt of his Guards. By which act, he thought, to haue made a great ſacrifice to God, in killing a King of a contrarie religion to his owne. Vpon which motion, being ſent backe againe by the Lord <hi>De la Gueſt,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to paſſe by Lyons, where he would inquire of ſome religious, if he might iuſtly kill the King, being conuerted to our religion: to whom was aunſwered, no.
<pb facs="tcp:14558:164"/>And beeing conſtrained in the ſame place to ſell his cloake, and a paire of ſilke ſlockings to get him victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, from Lyons he paſſed by Burgonie, then to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and in the ende, arriued at Melun, where hee had lien in a barne neere Saint <hi>Liens</hi> Church. Neere which place, a little before he had receiued the bleſſed Sacrament at Bricontre-robert vpon a working day, and that he was come to the kings Court to ſeeke a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And that if he were put to death, thoſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie would find themſelues grieued. He ſaid alſo, that the knife had coſt him 18. pence in Paris, and that he bought it to no other purpoſe but to vſe at the Table.</p>
               <p>The next day being the 29. he was examined the 4. time vpon the ſame articles: and amongſt other points whereof he was examined, he affirmed, that being at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he might haue had the Liuetenantſhip of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of S. Surlin, or vnder him, the leading of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of light-horſemen, if he had beene willing. Then <hi>Lugoly</hi> preſſed him, and asked him, why he held for the League, and parting thence, came to ſeeke ſeruice in the kings Court. At theſe words he remayned dumbe for a time, and at laſt ſaid, that he had aunſwered alreadie as the truth was. Foure witneſſes were examined againſt him. <hi>Brancaleon,</hi> who gaue information of <hi>Barriers</hi> counſel take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Lyons to ſlay the King, &amp; who had kept nothing hid from the Commiſſioners that he knew: the Iaylors wife, examined of the poyſon: Maiſter <hi>Peter</hi> the Ermite, concerning the knife: and Maiſter <hi>Thomas Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> the Curate of Bricontre-robert being called for, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to haue confeſſed him eight daies before, and the next day after communicated with him, and further, that he had told him how he had confeſſed himſelfe 4. daies before in the Citie of S. <hi>Dennis,</hi> but not a word of any thing concerning his attempt againſt the king. All theſe witneſſes, who of him were imbraced as coadiutors, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14558:164"/>councellers, are not onely not reproued, but withall, they atteſt their depoſitions to containe the verie truth of all they knew; <hi>Brancaleon</hi> excepted, who affirming, that he had communed with him of this enterpriſe againſt the King, acknowledged therewith, that he had eat &amp; drunk twiſe with him in the Lacobins houſe. The matter after this manner examined by <hi>Lugoly,</hi> the king cauſed by his Letters-patents, ſix Counſellers of the councel of State, accompanied with two Preſidents of ſoueraign Courts, to adiudge and giue ſentence of him as he had deſerued. Heere needed no doubt to be put of the lawfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt him. For was it not ſufficient, yea and by too too many proofs, to declare him guiltie and conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of that crime, in the execution whereof he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented? Was it not ynough to conuince him of the fact, who had confeſſed he had a mind to kill the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conuerſion; and miſſing of his purpoſe then, had ſince deliberated with 4. Munks at Lyons about the ſame act, to wit, whether he might iuſtly kill him or no. In witnes whereof, he that drunke with him at that time as he pretended to come to the Court for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, had pointed him forth to the King by euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular marke to make him known. Was there not matter ynough to iudge him guiltie, who had iudged himſelfe euen by his owne conſcience from his firſt committing into priſon, as wel by demaunding for poiſon, as alſo, for the murtherers knife, whereof hee was found ſeazed? Was there not euident proofe to condemne him, who confeſſed, he had left the League of purpoſe, to come to the Court only to ſeeke a Maiſter? Queſtionies, he was iuſtly iudged to die: And therefore by decree the 31. of Auguſt he was condemned to be drawne vpon a ſledge or tumbrell, &amp; as he paſt through the ſtreets, his fleſh to be pulled of with hot irons. This being done, to be led to the great market place, and there to haue his right hand burnt off with the knife in it: after that, to be laid vpon
<pb facs="tcp:14558:165"/>a ſcaffold, and ſo to haue his armes, legs, and thighes broken by the Executioner, and after his death, his body firſt to be conſumed to aſhes, and then to be caſt into the Riuer: his houſe razed, his goods confiſcated to the King. Moreouer, before his execution, he ſhould be pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with queſtions, aſwell ordinarie as extraordinarie, to learne by his owne mouth, who had induced him to this wicked enterpriſe. This was the ſumme of the ſentence denounced againſt him.</p>
               <p>Hitherto you haue ſeene nothing in this priſoner which chargeth the Ieſuits of Paris, neither likewiſe that he was diſtracted in mind, as <hi>Montaignes</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him, but rather a man aduiſed, who bare off euery blow in the beſt maner that he could: and from whom the Iudges drew by foure ſeueral examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, what they could for ſearching out the truth. The ſentence the ſame day being pronounced againſt him, the Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories were committed to two of his Iudges, and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goly</hi> to ſee them propounded vnto him, and to examine him. This poore wretch being there brought forth, requeſted them, that he might not be quartered quick, but rather giue him leaue, and he would to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, confeſſe the truth of euery particular poynt for that matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt then he began to lay open euery particuler con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the paſſage at Lyons, from poynt to poynt, at <hi>Brancaleon</hi> had deliuered of him to the King, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that in the ſaid Citie, he had conferred with foure religious perſons, to wit, a Carmelite, a Iacobin, a Capuchin, and a Ieſuit: with whom he agreed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this murther, and thereupon departed the next day after the Aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lady, to this inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t arriued he in Paris, and lodged himſelfe in the ſtreet, called <hi>De la Huchet,</hi> where he inquired who was the moſt zealous of Gods Church and honour in Paris. Whereunto one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, ſaying, the Curats of S. Andrewes of Arts.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:14558:165"/>
               <p>Hereupon, he preſently went to viſite him, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him his whole determination; where-with the Curate ſeemed well pleaſed, and made him drinke: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee ſhould gaine by that act, both great glory and Paradiſe. But before hee proceeded any further, it were very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, that he ſhould firſt goe viſit the Rector of the Ieſuits, of whom he might take more certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, he went to the Ieſuits Colledge, ſpake with their chiefe Commaunder, &amp; vnderſtood by him, that he had beene choſen Rector not paſt three weekes before. Marry after many faire ſpeeches, and friendlie entertainment, hee concluded, that his enterpriſe vvas moſt holy, and that with good conſtancie and courage he ſhould confeſſe himſelfe, and receiue the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and ſo led him into his Chamber, and gaue him his bleſſing. And the next day following, hee was confeſſed by an other Ieſuit, to whom hee would not diſcouer himſelfe by his confeſſion, but afterwards recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Sacrament in the Colledge of the Ieſuits. Hee likewiſe ſpake of it to another Ieſuit, a preacher of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, who ſpake often againſt the King, &amp; adiudged this counſell moſt holy, &amp; moſt merritorious: And for this act intended by him, bought the knife that was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Iuſtices hand, the poynt whereof he cauſed to be made ſharpe like a dagger poynt, as heeretofore hath beene recited.</p>
               <p>But to returne, he thus parting from Paris, went to S. <hi>Denys,</hi> where the King was, with a firme reſolution to kill him in the Church. But ſeeing the King ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly at Maſſe, as appald with feare, hee ſtayed his hand from that fact, euen as if he had loſt the vſe of his armes, or beene lame of his lymmes. From thence hee followed him to the Fort of <hi>Gournay,</hi> afterwards, to <hi>Bricontre-robert,</hi> where, after that he had beene confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; communicated againe, the King paſſed by, &amp; ſo
<pb facs="tcp:14558:166"/>eſcaped him, while he was drawing the knife out of his hoſe. Thus to be briefe, he arriued at Melun, where he was taken. And nowe when theſe Iudges came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him, and told him that it was ill done, to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued twice the holy Sacrament, hauing this bad inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his minde, knowing (as hee could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof) that it was to his damnation.</p>
               <p>Then began he to lament, and ſaid, that hee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie, and gaue thanks vnto God, in that he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented him from ſuch a wicked ſtroake. His confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were read vnto him, to the which he ſtood, without deniall of one word. His confeſſions (I ſay) made ere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he felt one twitch of the rope. So being fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence drawne to the place of execution, as hee was vppon the Scaffold. <hi>Lugoly</hi> willed him to tell the truth, warning him to take heede that hee ſhould not charge any one wrongfully. Vnto which he aunſwered, that all which he had ſaid in the place of examination was true. Of which hee asked God, the King, and the Iuſtices for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes.</p>
               <p>This done, he had his right hand burned in flaming fire, afterwards, his armes, legs, and thighes broken, &amp; he was put vppon the wheele, where the Iudges meant to haue left him languiſhing, till hee had giuen vp the ghoſt. But there againe examined, if hee would ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for the diſcharge of his conſcience? Hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that whatſoeuer he had ſaid, was true, and no more but the truth: and that there were two blacke Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which went from Lyons to the ſame intent, but hee tooke vpon him to be moſt forward to archiue the act, for the honour of the enterpriſe. Thus moſt humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting the Iudges to ridde him out of his paine, that his ſoule by deſpaire might not be loſt with his bodie. Vpon theſe words, <hi>Lugoly,</hi> by the commaundement of other Iudges, cauſed him to be ſtrangled: and the next day, his body was conſumed into aſhes, and the aſhes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14558:166"/>caſt into the Riuer. After the execution doone, which was vppon Tueſday, the 31. of Auguſt, newes vvas brought by a Cittizen of Melun to Paris, (for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages were free wherſoeuer, by reaſon of a truce made:) And vpon the Sonday following, one <hi>Commolet,</hi> a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, made a ſermon, about the end whereof, he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his audients to haue patience, for you ſhall ſee (quoth he) within fewe dayes, a wonderfull miracle of God, which is at hand, you ſhall ſee it, yea, eſteeme it as alreadie come. Theſe words vttered openly in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an innumerable multitude, cauſed the Iudges to be moſt aſſured, that what ſoeuer <hi>Barriere</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, was moſt true.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue moſt faithfully diſcourſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, what was the proceedings of <hi>Barriere,</hi> now ye may well gather, that what-ſoeuer is penned downe by the Pleader of Clairmont Colledge, and againe by <hi>Montaignes,</hi> within his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous truths, are as it were old womens fables, ſuch as we read in the moſt part of their anuall Epiſtles, ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their friends. And moreouer, that <hi>Barriere</hi> was not a plaine ſimple and innocent man, but rather one moſt reſolute, and ſtoute, who ſtoode vppon his garde as much as in him lay: yea, before the Magiſtrate, and who after his condemnation, had his memory ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as he could intreat that he might not be committed to the mercie of the Wheele, or other torture. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt falſe is that which <hi>Montaignes</hi> giueth out of him; that he was frighted, and his memorie paſt him, by
<pb facs="tcp:14558:167"/>meanes of the torments hee ſuffered. This (I ſay) vvas falſe; for he was neuer tortured, vntill his confeſſions of the fact were all ended, as is before ſet down at large.</p>
               <p>Before the ſentence of death was denounced, the Iudges ſhewed no great ſuſpition had of the Ieſuits, but hauing found ſufficient matter to condemne the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to death, then they all gaue conſent (by reaſon of his fact) that he ſhould be plyed with queſtions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might reueale his pretences. So that without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to the tortures, (ſeeing it was in vaine to delay) hee declared each thing in particuler of that which was paſt. And thereupon, as you haue heard, he accuſed 4. religious perſons of Lyons, &amp; amongſt others, a Ieſuit, without naming him. But the Gentlemen, by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition haue informed vs, that it was one <hi>Petrus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iorius.</hi> Afterwards he recited what had beene done with him at Paris, in the Ieſuits Colledge there, by him that held the firſt place, to wit, the Rector, whoſe name al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hee knewe not. But <hi>Montaignes</hi> hath diſcouered him vnto vs by the name of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As indeede it was a thing eaſily knowne, for that he then commaunded in the Colledge: adding thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that the King beeing ſince entred into Paris, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arade</hi> ſaued himſelfe by agilitie of body, taking himſelfe to flight; as one that knew full well, there was no ſurer witnes againſt him then his owne conſcience.</p>
               <p>As touching <hi>Commolet,</hi> there needed no other vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes then thoſe which were at his ſermon. Moreouer, paſſages on each ſide were free and at liberty, by reaſon of the truce made: ſo that many honeſt perſons, which had with-drawn themſelues by flight into Melun, being now come backe againe into Paris, vnderſtood this great miracle of which he prophecied. Concerning the reſt, the priſoner before hee was put to death, perſiſted vpon the Scaffold in all that hee had ſaid and ſpoken in the place of examination: &amp; againe after that, vpon the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14558:167"/>wheele, beeing full of good memory and vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for they had medled with no part about him, but onely the breaking of his armes, thighes, and legs. And after he had perſeuered a while in that paine, he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <hi>Lugoly</hi> not to occaſionate his fall into deſpaire, and that looſing his body, hee might not alſo there-with looſe his ſoule. Vppon which wordes, the ſaide <hi>Lugoly</hi> cauſed him to be ſtrangled, after that he had giuen his laſt report vnto the Iuſtices of all, and had receiued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to doe it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, it is a moſt ſhamefull lie, to publiſh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arade</hi> found him ſo weake of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that hee could not in any wiſe giue credite vnto him. It was a moſt notorious lie to ſay, that the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Barriere,</hi> were forceably taken from him at his examination, notwithſtanding that he was not queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned withall but twice at ſeuerall times vppon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, where he perſiſted vpon thoſe poynts which hee had confeſſed in other places, as I here haue ſaid. As touching other matters, of the meeting of the Diuines, &amp; the Scarffe which was hung at S. <hi>Paules,</hi> if there had beene any ſuch thing, no queſtion but hee would haue confeſſed it as willingly as he did the reſt. I come again to thoſe flattering ſpeeches, which the ſecond Ieſuit fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the King withall, to the end that his Societie might be reeſtabliſhed. Where are now theſe faire ſpeeches?</p>
               <p>It behoueth not (ſaith he) the King of Fraunce to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the quarrels of the King of Nauar, neither the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſon of the Church, to be mooued with an opinion contrary to the Church. Is not this a ſhameleſſe Piper, who would againe vnawares ouercome our king by the ſound of his pipe? I haue here from the beginning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the plauſible perſwaſions of the Ieſuits, to the end euery one might know, that there is no better to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, to come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch lying lips as they haue. I haue here fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, ſet down the hiſtory of <hi>Barriere,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:168"/>to the end, that each one might know, that it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe worſe, and that there is not in the world any beaſt more cruell, ſubtile and fierce, then is the Ieſuit: wherefore, all men ought by all meanes poſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of his treaſons. But I pray you, howe were theſe Nets ſpred, &amp; of what ſtuffe were they? Marry ſo long as the King was of another religion then ours is, the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits neuer made ſhew of any willingneſſe or intent to haue him murdered; no not in the greateſt broyles of our troubles: And now, being reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to our church, vppon ſome feare which was reſident in them, as they fayned, leaſt that the King made himſelfe a Catholicke vpon diſſimulation, this (ſaid they) was cauſe of offering vnto his Maieſtie ſuch cruell warres. But when? in the midſt of the ſworne truce, when euery man eſteemed himſelfe to be at reſt whereſoeuer he liued, by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and mutuall fayth which euery one had giuen one towards another, then began this newe counfell to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Iudas</hi> had neuer any purpoſe to kill the King before hee became a Catholicke: becauſe they deemed, that as long as hee was plunged in his error, the people whom they helde in theyr rebellion, would neuer be drawne to liue ſubiected vnder his obedience. But as ſoone as he was conuerted, they doubting of theyr for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, fearing leaſt his reconciliation might reduce them beeing his ſubiects, to theyr accuſtomed dutie, they hereuppon endeuoured with all their power to preuent it, and thought by one meanes or other hee ſhould be ſlaine, to enioy afterwards that priuiledge which they vſe, and likewiſe to place ſuch a Monarch in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as eſteemed himſelfe moſt ſtrong, and one that ſhould ſtand to theyr deuotion.</p>
               <p>My intent &amp; meaning is, that this matter be handled, not onely before our holy Father the Pope, &amp; his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie, but alſo, that it ſhould come before the meaneſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14558:168"/>perſon in the world, if he haue any ſparke of religion &amp; iudgement. For was there euer impietie more abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable then this? That our Ieſuits ſhould haue charmed ſuch a weake ſpirit as this was, by the holy Sacraments of the Church, &amp; haue inticed him to murder the king? Not becauſe that he was an heretick, but by reaſon that they ſuſpected there was diſſimulation in his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Be it that they ſuſpected hee was but diſſemblinglie conuerted, which I beleeue not. But admit that they had ſuſpected it, yet is it therefore of neceſſitie, that the life of ſo great a King, ſhould depend vppon theyr vaine imagination? and that vppon this pretence, they ſhould counſell ſuch a deteſtable murther? and barter likewiſe to haue compacted with thoſe, that would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, to giue them Paradiſe for a counterchange? Beſides, in giuing more ſcope to theyr wickednes, they haue abuſed the holy Sacrament of the Altar. O God, was there euer a wickeder Atheiſme ſince the world was a world?</p>
               <p>It was not onely a ſimple King of Nauarre whom they ſhot at, but the greateſt King that euer Fraunce enioyed. It was not a Prince of a contrary fayth to ours, but rather him, vvho vvith all humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had reduced himſelfe into the boſome of the Church. Now will we giue care to this cogging Ieſuit, I deceiue my ſelfe: but wee will heare him to the end, that, that which hee hath handled, may ſerue for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation againſt him, and all his.</p>
               <p>But behold, what fruite had our Catholick Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Romaine Church brought forth, if this hateful counſell had come to an effect. Doubt you not, but that the conuerſion of our King, was vnto the Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots a great cut in their harts. So that if any miſchance had hapned vnto him, as touching his life, by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, good God, how would they haue ſet vp their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb facs="tcp:14558:169"/>againſt vs in their aſſemblies? What ſubiect might their Miniſters haue had to haue thundred out, yea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in their Pulpets, bringing heauen and earth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to haue ſaid, that it was a blowe come from heauen: by reaſon that the King hauing forſaken their Church, (theſe be the wordes which they would haue vſed) God had permitted it that hee ſhould be ſo ſoone taken out of the world, yea, &amp; by thoſe religious Prieſts vnto whom hee yeelded himſelfe. Mighty they not haue had great occaſion to haue ſaid vnto them; Our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in theyr Pulpits, handle a thouſand matters with leſſe loſſe then that was?</p>
               <p>Had it not beene a meanes to maintaine them in their errours in ſtedde of preuenting them? Did not all thys turne to the ruine and deſolation of the holy Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Sea of Rome, of which our Ieſuits ſay they are Protectors. Theyr propoſition is not Catholicke, but rather Anabaptiſticall, the which they reuiue againe in minding to take away the life of Kings.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T happened vpon Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Euangeliſts day, beeing the 27. of December, 1594. after the reducing of Paris vnder obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Soueraigne, that the King going to his Chamber, accompanied with many Princes and Lords, founde himſelfe vnlookt for ſuddenly ſtrooken in the mouth with a knife, ſo that neither he, nor thoſe that were with him, could perceiue it: for aſſoone as <hi>Iohn Chastell</hi> who was the Traytor, &amp;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14558:169"/>but nineteene yeeres of age, had giuen the ſtroke, he dropped downe the knife, and ſette himſelfe in the midſt of the preaſe. He was but young and none would haue deemed this furious enterpriſe to haue beene in ſo tender yeeres.</p>
               <p>Euerie one was in a maze, and buſie to thinke who had done that traiterous deed, and it wanted not much, but that this yong youth had made an eſcape. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, God would not permit, that this deteſtable act ſhould remain vnpuniſhed. By chance it was, that ſome one caſting his eyes vpon him, he became as one ſore affrighted and appald with feare. But as he promiſed himſelfe to haue the Paradice of Ieſuits if he died one of their maytyrs, ſo alſo he confeſſed this fact more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and promptly then was looked for at his hands. Whereupon, by decree of the Court of Parliament in Paris, he was condemned to die. Now here the Ieſuits make a great boaſting of their innocencie, ſaying, that in his examination, and out of it alſo, he neuer charged any one of them: but all that he had done proceeded of his owne will, and that in this confeſſion he perſeuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the laſt gaſpe of his life. As for my part, I haue no greater argument then this, to ſhew that the trade of murthering was lodged within their Colledges. And where there was any exerciſe of good education and ſtudie, no ſcholler would haue vndertaken ſuch a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable determination, but ſuch a one as was brought vp vnder them. Wherefore we remayne all in one minde, that he had there ſtudied and paſſed his courſe in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie. True it is, that it was reported, that he had not beene conuerſant there for the ſpace of eight moneths paſt.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this diuerſitie is moſt eaſie, for in the other Colledges, they know not what it meant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct ſchollers how to murther Kings, and ſpecially in ours. But in the Ieſuits Colledges, it is contrarie, and
<pb facs="tcp:14558:170"/>preached in their owne aſſemblies nothing ſo much as that alone. Of the which indeed they were but too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall in their Sermons: ſo as this young boy, hauing as yet his ſoule infected with their poyſon, being newly departed from their ſchooles, was not altogether healed.</p>
               <q>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens, ſoruabit adorem Teſta diu.</q>
               <p>Behold how that vpon the auncient inſtructions and memories of the Ieſuits, their Diſciples ſuppoſe to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a holy ſacrifice vnto God in committing murther, yea, and that of Princes. The ſame hapned ſometime in Italy, where there was one <hi>Cola Mentcuan,</hi> who taught they youths of Millan in ſtudies of humanitie, and amongſt the chiefeſt diſcourſes of his Dictates, he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ordinarily of no other thing, but happie is he who with the price of his blood, redeemeth a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealth from the bondage of a Tyrant. Theſe diſcourſes tooke ſuch hold with three Gentlemen of a Towne named Caſes, and of the families of the Empoignane, Viſcont, and Olgiate, that hauing attained to ripenes of yeeres, they coſulted together to put in execution the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Maiſter. And in concluſion, vpon S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> day in Chriſtmas, as <hi>Iohn Galeas,</hi> Duke of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, went into the great Church to heare Maſſe, they doubted not but to murther him in open ſight of all the people: though they were aſſured, that hardly they ſhould eſcape the furies of the Dukes guard, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto them. For in the ſame place there were two of them ſlaine, and the third who had eſcaped, was taken ſome few dayes after, and led to the gallowes, where he confeſſed, none but himſelfe and his fellowes, as <hi>Chastell</hi> did. And neuertheleſſe, the truth is ſo well noted and knowen by the Hiſtoriographers of Italy, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of <hi>Cola</hi> their Maiſter, had been their firſt ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or prouoker. By theſe meanes, our Ieſuits are verie ſcoffers, when they think to excuſe themſelues vpon the anſwers of <hi>Chaſtell.</hi> I know not whether they were ſuch
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14558:170"/>as they affirme, but wel I wot, that al their Lectures and Sermons, tend to no other but bloodſhed, exhorting men to murther: therby yeelding themſelues ſole pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſureties, for their Paradice that will vndertake this great maiſter-peece of worke.</p>

This holy Councell chiefly deſiring (as it is bound, &amp; therfore aſſembled) to prouide for the rooting out of errors, &amp; hereſies, which now begin to ſpread abroad in diuers parts of the world, hath lately beene enformed, that ſome divulge opinions, erronious in faith, againſt good manners, and verie ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, tending to the ſubuerſion of the whole State, and order in States, among which this aſſertion paſſeth for currant. Euery Tyrant may, and ought lawfully and meritoriouſly to be killed by any his Vaſſal, &amp; ſubiect, euen by ambuſhments or flatteries, or faire allurements: notwithſtanding any oath paſſed vnto him, or League made with him, and without attending the ſentence, or commaund of any Iudge whatſoeuer. Which this holy Counſel endeauouring to reſiſt, and wholly to root out, decrees, ordaines, and iudgeth, to be erronious both in matters of faith, and manners: and reprooues and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes it as a point moſt ſcandalous, opening the way vnto all manner of guiles, deceits, lies, treaſons, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries. An ordinance which I reſpect, and reuerence, not only becauſe it was enacted in that great counſel of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> wherby the abuſes of the Church, and hereſie, were rooted vp, but in that it was deriued from our Fraunce, <hi>Gerſon</hi> being the firſt, and principall Solicitor againſt the new Diuines, who then had intertained this opinion; which ſince that time, our Ieſuits haue reuiued in the death of good king <hi>Heny,</hi> whom they called a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, &amp; had done the like to our great King now liuing, if God by his holy grace had not preſerued him. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Ieſuits would ſeem to deny their <hi>Peter Mathew,</hi> as not being of their Sect, what ſay they to father <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Sa,</hi> terming himſelfe a Doctor of Diuinitie, and of their Societie; who by two artcles in his Aphoriſmes of confeſſion, hath maintained, that it is lawfull for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to kill the Tyrant, and to expell a misbeleeuing Prince out of his Realme: as if the people could, or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14558:172"/>ſhould giue lawes vnto their King, whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them to be their ſoueraigne Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>I am aſhamed that I muſt prooue, no ſubiect ought to attatch his Prince, what part ſoeuer he doth play: but hauing vndertaken to combate an hereſy which Ieſuits haue practized by deeds, &amp; now would faine go from it in words, I purpoſe to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a fulſome gorge therof. Learne therefore of me this leſſon, Ieſuit, (for I owe this duty to al Chriſtians) we ought to obey our kings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they be, (I will ſay) good or badde, this is that the wiſe man teacheth vs in his Prouerbs, S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, S. <hi>Paule</hi> vnto the Romans, to <hi>Titus,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Baruch,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Nabuchodonozer,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, of all other Princes, had made to fall into a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſenſe; the goodly example of <hi>Dauid</hi> perſecuted by <hi>Saul.</hi> Such Kings as God beſtoweth on vs, ſuch are we to receiue without examining, as thou doſt, whither they be Kings, or Tyrants. The hearts of Kings are in the hands of God; they execute his iuſtice euen as it pleaſeth him to puniſh vs, or more, or leſſe, whereto we are not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelues, but by our humble praiers vnto him: if we deale otherwiſe, we reſemble thoſe ouerweening Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants deſcribed by ancient Poets, who offring to skale the heauens, there to ſit cheek by iowle with Gods, were in a moment tumbled down to hel by their god <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Yet ought not a King abuſe his power, but know he is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not to prouoke his ſubiects, his children, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery ſleight occaſion; for if he do, God the father of Fathers, &amp; king of Kings, wil (when he leaſt thinks of it) dart his vengeance againſt him with a moſt dreadful &amp; horrible arme. To conclude, ſeeing that thou Ieſuit, yeeldeſt a blind obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to thy ſuperiors, who are but thy adopted Lords, thou oweſt it in greater meaſure a hundred-fold vnto thy King, thy true, lawfull, naturall Lord, &amp; father.

<pb facs="tcp:14558:173"/>not that I know not the great difference which is betweene the one &amp; the other; but we are to blindfold our eyes vnder their obedience, otherwiſe we ſhroud a rebellion of ſubiects againſt their Prince; Rebellion which produceth much more euell then the tyrannie whereunto we were ſubiect.</p>

               <p>THere remained in the confines of Spain, certaine dregs of the Marranes, whom king <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had chaſed out of that realme, &amp; therfore got the title of Catholique, a ſurname wherwith his ſucceſſors haue ſince adornd themſelues. One of theſe raſcals, mounted on a Mule accoaſted <hi>Ignace</hi> on the high way (ſomwhat after he had changed his former life:) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning told one another to what place they were bent, they entred into ſundry diſcourſes, &amp; at length fell into talke of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom the Moore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for a true Virgin before her Conception, but not after: grounding his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on natural reaſons, the which haue no affinity with our faith. <hi>Ignace</hi> vrged the contrary, with good deuotion, that ſhe was a Virgin both before, &amp; at, and after her deliuery, &amp; ſearched eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner of his braine to make it good. But being then a ſimple nouice, &amp; if you wil needs know it, but an a. b. c. man in points of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was not for him to manage ſo high miſteries: ſo that ſupplying the want of arguments (wherof he had none left) with a iuſt choller, the Moore who laughed at him in his mind, ſpurring his Mule, and giuing him a ful carriere, left <hi>Ignace</hi> all alone, who cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing that he was not able to get the victory at the blunt of the tongue, went yet to win it at the ſharp with the ſword; and ſo reſolued to purſue him amaine, &amp; preſently to kil
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14558:173"/>him. Notwithſtanding, like a man of a good conſcience, he found himſelfe extreamly perplexed. For on the one ſide, it vexed him to ſee a monſter fraught with impiety and blaſphemie, goe vpon the ground; on the other, he weighed his owne feare of offending the Virgin, in ſted of defending her. In this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention, ſuſpended between yea and no, at length hee determined to take his Mules aduiſe. Hee ſawe the fellowe paſſe into a croſſe way, and knew whether it led: wherefore, in admirable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he reſolued, not to ſlacken the reynes of his chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, but to giue his beaſt the bridle; on condition, that if of her owne inſtinct ſhe followed the tract of that Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell along the croſſe-way, he would diſpatch him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all remiſsion: but, as God would haue it, ſhe choſe another path, by meanes whereof, <hi>Ignacius</hi> ſuddenly appeaſed himſelfe, ſuppoſing the matter happened to his Mule by diuine inſpiration.</p>
               <p>God ſometimes giues aduiſe vnto falſe Prophets by their beaſts; as we read of <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe, and this <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his Mule, without the which he had moſt furiouſly executed his diſseignment.

               <p>After the decree of the yeere 1564. had paſſed, we liued in ſome reſt throughout all Fraunce, vntil the yere 1567. about which time, the enteruiew had at Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene vs and the Spanyard, vndid vs. For it put iealouſies (perhaps not without cauſe) into the hart of ſuch as were not thorowly ſetled. Ielouſies that bred in Fraunce tenne thouſand miſchiefes, which to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, makes my haire to ſtare. Nowe let vs examine the Ieſuits carriage during this looſe &amp; generall corruption. A ſurceaſing from Armes being appointed in councel, the yeere 64, they thought alſo to haue had leyſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the venting their ambition. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their cauſe was pleaded, that irregular profeſſion of theirs was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie dealt againſt: the wiſer ſort foreſaw, as in a clowde, that this Impoſtume could not chuſe in time, but yeelde a malignant and lothſome matter, though to poynt at it in particuler, none either could, or durſt; becauſe that outward ſimplicitie wherewith they ſhadowed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts, ſurpriſed euen ſuch as wiſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt euill; for they imagined the Ieſuits would haue forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our Religion, by good examples, zealous prayers, wholeſome manners, holy exhortations, and not by Armes.</p>
               <p>But ſtayed they in theſe termes? nothing leſſe, they brought into their houſes, the knowledge of State mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they made themſelues Iudges of Princes actions, diſpoſing them at their owne pleaſure; they contriued warres thereby to compaſſe their deſſignes: and the Pulpits out of which they preached, were to no other vſe, but as Drums, Fifes, and Trumpets, to incenſe our Princes in theyr combats one againſt another. And
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14558:175"/>eſpecially, we are not to doubt of their beeing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, ſolicitors, and cheriſhers of our laſt troubles, a thing which not onely they denie not, but make theyr boaſt of in their bookes, as you may find in that of the Ieſuit <hi>La Fon.</hi> I vndertake not in this place to recite at large the ſtorie of theſe troubles, this only I wil tel you, that before the yere 1576, wee neuer had put the word <hi>League</hi> in vſe: it was onely familiar in Italie, the chiefe harbor of Ieſuits. VVhen the Parliament was held at Blois, a Lord of ſome note in Paris, (whom I will not name) whoſe hart was wholly Ieſuited, and who on fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiuall dayes, left his own Pariſh-church to be preſent at their Maſſes ſent to the Deputies of Paris theſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following.</p>
               <p>In this aſſembly, ſome laboured harde to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall &amp; mercileſſe war, againſt the Hugonots, &amp; yet demaunded an abatement of Subſidies: a propoſition ill ſorting with the former, thoſe Subſidies hauing heen introduced of purpoſe to further the warres. By means whereof, the man of whom I ſpeake, taking firſt aduiſe of the Ieſuits, propounded a third courſe, to league the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the Hugonots, and that ſuch as willing lie enroled themſelues vnder the League, ſhould be bound to contribute vnto the charge of this new warre. Theſe inſtructions receiued and publiſhed, the Deputies did nominate a certaine Prince to be their head. The laſt King, knowing of what conſequence this practiſe was, and that ſucceeding, it would make 3. parties in France, his owne, (which was not one properly) that of the League, another of the Hugonots: to breake this blow, diſcreetly affirmed, that he approued well this League, but that be would be chiefe thereof: which was to the end the League ſhould flie no further then he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to giue it wings.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtone of our ruine beeing caſt in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Prouoſts of the Merchants, and the Sheriffes
<pb facs="tcp:14558:176"/>of Paris, returning home, and loath that thys opinion of a League (which they held moſt holy) ſhould miſcarie, ſent theyr Commiſſions throughout all the Wards, to to the end, that ſuch as would contribute, ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their names. The Conſtables bare them vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie houſe, ſome hardier then the reſt, oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the greater number, fearing worſe, ſubſcribed. The Commiſſion was brought to <hi>Christopher le Tou,</hi> chiefe Iuſtice, whoſe memorie vvee cannot honour too much: this good Lord, refuſed not onely to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, but detayned the Commiſſion it ſelfe, and the next day, in open Court deteſted this vnhappy inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, as an aſſured deſolation to our ſtate. His autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, his honeſtie, his reaſons, wrought ſo great effect, that euery one allowed, and followed his aduiſe. From thence-foorth, this opinion of the League did weare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or rather vvas remitted to another ſeaſon, that better might befit the purpoſes of ſuch as broached it.</p>
               <p>Suddainly, after the Parliament was ended, Father <hi>Aimon Auger,</hi> a Ieſuit, got the King to giue eare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him through his plauſible hypocriſies: And after him, Father <hi>Claudius Matthew</hi> of Lorraine; both the which had ſo great part in his good fauour, that (as <hi>Montaignes</hi> teſtifieth) hee ſome-times cauſed them to ride along with him in his owne Coach. At length, this good King, founde that theſe coozeners, were deſirous to incroach vppon the managing of State-matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, <hi>Auger</hi> eſpecially; whom for that cauſe, hee gaue order to his Embaſſadour at Rome, to get him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued out of Fraunce, by Letters of obedience from his Generall.</p>
               <p>The King departing from the Parliament, pacified his ſubiects by an Edict of the yeere 1577. the which hee ſayd was vvholly his owne; and yet had by his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, cleane daſhed the reformed Religion without
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14558:176"/>bloodſhed, if the Ieſuits would haue vouchſafed him the leiſure to finiſh what he had begun: Wageing in the midſt of peace, a gentle warre againſt the Hugonots: gentle, but more forcible in great mens oppinions then any weapons could haue made it. For although that the Edict of 77. gaue ſome libertie vnto them, yet the king neither called them to places of iudgement, nor vnto offices in his Exchequer, nor to the gouernments of Prouinces and Townes.</p>
               <p>Hee had moreouer deuiſed the order of the holie Ghoſt, reſerued wholly for Catholicke Princes and Lords, as alſo, that of the Hieronimitans of our Lady of Vincennes, where none were to appeare, but Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Romane Catholiques, and with whom (laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his moſt high authoritie) he fraternized in all kind of deuotion. Nowe, the preſence of theſe, cauſing the others abſence, belieue it was no ſmall meanes to force them into the right way. For there is nothing which the French Nobilitie affect ſo much, as to be neere theyr King, nor any thing that afflicts the common people more, then to be kept from Offices: this is a diſeaſe of minde that ſpoyles the Frenchman.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as a Lawyer, or Marchant, haue by theyr endeuours, ſtuffed theyr Cloſets and Storehouſes with ſiluer, the thing they chiefely ayme at, is to beſtowe it on places of Iudgement, or roomes in the Exchequer for theyr Children: ſo that the newe Religion beganne alreadie to diſſolute, and it grieued not the Auncients thereof (vvho for ſhame, and to auoyde the imputation of lightnes, ſtucke vnto it) to ſuffer their chyldren to be inſtructed in our Schooles, and conſequently to learne there the principles of our Religion.</p>
               <p>All matters in this ſort proceeded, from ill to well, from well to better; the Countriman plyed harde his plough; the Artificer his trade; the Merchant his traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique; the Lawyer his practiſe; the Cittizen enioyed his
<pb facs="tcp:14558:177"/>reuenew; the Magiſtrate his ſtipend; the Catholick his owne religion throughout all Fraunce, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment. The remainder of thoſe Hugonots that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, being ſequeſtred into a backe corner of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; when our Ieſuits ſeeing themſelues remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr Princes fauour, beganne to lay this ſnare to intrap him.</p>
               <p>Euen as the Societie of Ieſuits, is compoſed of all ſorts of people, ſome for the pen, others for practiſe; ſo had they amongſt them, one Father <hi>Henry Sammier</hi> of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourge, a man diſpoſed for all aſſayes, and reſolued vnto any hazard. This fellow was ſent by them in the yeere 1581, towards diuers Catholicke Princes to ſounde the Foorde: And to ſay truly, they could not haue choſen one more fit; for he diſguiſed himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as many formes as obiects, one while attired like a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, another while like a Prieſt, by and by like a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Swaine: Dice, cardes, and women, were as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with him, as his prefixed houres of prayer; ſaying, he did not thinke he ſinned in this, becauſe it was done to the furtherance of a good worke, to the exaltation of Gods glorie, and that hee might not be diſcouered: changing his name together with his habite, according to the Countries wherein he purpoſed to negotiate. He parted from Lorraine, and thence went into Germany, Italie, and Spaine. The ſumme of his inſtructions were, that foreſeeing the eminent danger of our Catholick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the ſeeming conniuence which the King gaue to it, and ſecret fauour hee yeelded on the other ſide to the Hugonots, whereof the Duke his brother had made himſelfe an open Protector in the Lowe-Countries, their holie ſocietie had reſolued to vndertake this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell vnder the leading of a great Prince, making ſure account of Gods aſſiſtance, ſeeing that it was directed to the aduauncement of his holy Name, and good of his Church.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:14558:177"/>
               <p>Thus <hi>Sammier</hi> got intelligence from each part, and tooke aſſurance on all hands: but preſently to manifeſt their proiects, the ſeaſon fitted not; becauſe the Duke was aliue, and the two brothers forces once vnited, were ſufficient to ſwallow all ſuch as had made head againſt them. And this was but the preamble vnto our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. In the yeere 83. he died. That let remoued, the Ieſuits imbarqued in their quarrell ſuch Lords as they thought good: and from thence forward, Father <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Mathew</hi> Prouinciall of Paris, deales in the matter more earneſtly then before; ſits and aſſiſts in all delibe rations, and counſels, takes vpon him a iourney vnto Rome, &amp; Father <hi>Henry Sammier,</hi> another into Spayne; where they ſo wel acquitted themſelues in their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13. and the Spaniſh King promiſed, each for his part, a great ſumme of money towards the maintenance of this warre. The Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors being once returned, we beheld Enſignes diſplaid, Fraunce couered with ſouldiers, and many Townes ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, wherein there neuer had beene any exerciſe of new Religion.</p>
               <p>Now might you ſee three parties on foot, the Kings, very much entangled; that of the holy League; (ſo was the Ieſuits warre intituled) &amp; that of the Religion; for ſo the Hugonots did terme their faction. Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> died: then feared the Ieſuit he ſhould looſe halfe of his credit, for which cauſe father <hi>Mathew</hi> returned backe to Rome, where he found Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> choſen, of whom to his exceeding great contentment he obtained the like promiſe his predeceſſor had made him before. In his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he died at Ancona, the yere 1588. by means wherof a new ſuit is begun by Father <hi>Odon Pigenat</hi> a Burgonian (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elected Prouincial of France by deceaſe of <hi>Mathew</hi>) which was not reiected by <hi>Sixtus.</hi> This gaue occaſion to certaine Catholiques, not onely to propound a peace, but euen to wiſh it in their ſoules. Yet not withſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:14558:178"/>ſome there were, that would haue bridled our thoughts: for this propoſition diſliked our Ieſuits. There be two ſorts of Catholiques, the one called Pollititians, of worſe condition then Hugonots, becauſe they wiſht for peace; the other zealous Catholiques, or Leaguers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of the commmon people, becauſe they deſired an endleſſe warre: a diſtinction that planted a Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of warres betweeene Catholique and Catholique, and withal, procured a peace with our common enemy. What ſay I, a peace? we put hereby a ſword into his hands to beat vs with, we opened him the way to raunge in, to come forward, to thriue, to increaſe without our reſiſtance, we who had enfeebled our ſelues by this ſame new diuiſion.</p>
               <p>Armes were taken on all hands, and yet was it not a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warre only, it was a general throat-cutting all France ouer: which to remedy, our two Kings had ſucceſſiuely need of all their peeces: and ſo the Hugonot came by a good part in their quarrell, for the maintenance, &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the State. And the Ieſuits Colledges were mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly the places whereto the other ſide vſually reſorted. There were forged their Goſpells in Cyphers, which they ſent into diuers countries: there were their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles beſtowed into ſundry Prouinces, ſome to vpholde the troubles by their preaching, as their father <hi>Iames Commolet</hi> within Paris, and their father <hi>Bernard Rouillet</hi> within Bourges, others to commit murther, and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arade,</hi> &amp; the ſame <hi>Commolet.</hi> Not ſo much but father <hi>Odon Pigenot</hi> ſeaſed in all credit, prerogatiue, and authoritie among the Sixteene of Paris, (dregs of the vulgar, and entertainers of ſedition:) A thing all Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits agree on, in the bookes which they haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſince the yeere, 94.</p>
               <p>I haue ſaid (and truly ſaid) that Ieſuitiſme, argeeth with the Anabaptiſts opinion in two propoſitions: In medling with State matters; and in cauſing Princes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14558:178"/>and Kings to be murthered, accordingly to the conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie of their affaires. I will adde, that in the carriage of this Ieſuiticall warre within Fraunce, there was ſome conformitie of names betweene, this, and that the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts vndertooke in Germanie the yeere 1535. For they had one <hi>Iohn Mathew</hi> their chiefe Prophet, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Iohn Leydon</hi> their king, and one <hi>Bernard Rotman,</hi> and <hi>Bernard Cniperdolin,</hi> principal actors in their faction for the ſeducing of ſimple people: euen as our Ieſuits had their father <hi>Clauaius Mathew,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bernard Rouillet.</hi> I will not here recite the other particulars of our troubles, being contented plainely to haue ſhewed vnto you, that our Ieſuits were the firſt Seminaries thereof: onely I will diſcourſe what fruit we haue reaped by them. God withdrawing his anger from vs, would in the ende ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe all matters. In this reeſtabliſhment, the Hugonots, who during our troubles thinke they haue beene ſome inſtruments of keeping the Crowne on the Kings head, as well as other Subiectes, which were Catholiques, haue alſo thought, that after the peace was made, they ought not to bee accounted as outcaſtes from among vs: therefore haue they importuned the King by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry requeſts, to reſtore them to their auncient Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, graunted them by the Edicts of Pacification, from which, ſince the peace of the yeere 77. they haue beene almoſt wholly driuen.</p>
               <p>Wee haue, ſaid they, followed yours, and the laſt Kings fortunes during your troubles, we haue expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our liues and goods for the vpholding of your royall eſtate, againſt the Ieſuiticall faction, which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a Sraunger to make him Lord, and Maiſter of your Kingdome. Is it meete, that wee, for our good ſeruice to you, ſhould looſe our part in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth and gouernment, and that the Ieſuits, for hauing vſed all the badde practiſes they could againſt you, ſhould beare ſway, rule, and triumph in your
<pb facs="tcp:14558:179"/>Realme of Fraunce? What could a wiſe and prudent King doe in this caſe, being preſt with ſo iuſt a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this was? What? but aſſent thereunto: to auoid of two miſchiefes the greater, and not to fall backe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that gulph, out of which we were newly but eſcaped. Tell me, I beſeech you, to whom are we beholding for this laſt Alarum in Fraunce, but onely to our Ieſuits, the firebrands of our lateſt troubles? Which troubles had they not beene, the Hugonots credit had beene vtterly ouer-throwne. This is one bond amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein we ſtand obliged to that holy Societie of Ieſus.</p>

               <p>As the priuiledges, which they perſwade themſelues haue beene graunted them for the Catechiſing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing of youth, haue peruerted all the auncient order of famous Vniuerſities: ſo this large and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie licence, permitted them in matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, hath beene the cauſe, that the greateſt part of the people, haue in great and haynous ſinnes, forſaken the auncient cuſtome, of reſorting to the Penitentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Cathedrall Churches, and had recourſe to the Ieſuits, whom wee ſee by vertue of this Bull, to be all of them authorized for Penitentiaries. And God knowes how farre theſe holy and bleſſed Fathers haue abuſed it. The firſt breaking forth of our troubles, was in the yeere 1585. at which time all that reſorted to them to be confeſſed, if they affirmed themſelues to be good ſubiects, and loyall ſeruitors to the King (for they were
<pb facs="tcp:14558:180"/>queſtioned vpon that article) they were ſent backe by the Ieſuits without receiuing abſolution. Which beeing obiected againſt them by <hi>Arnauldus,</hi> marke I beſeech you, the cold aunſwere which they make in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt his accuſations. For in the 17. article it is obiected (ſaith <hi>Arnauldus</hi>) that the ſaid Defendants, haue at diuers &amp; ſundry times, denied abſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them that ſtoode for the late King, from the yeere 1585.

There is no ſmoak without ſome fire.</p>
               <p>Read their annuall letters of the yeere 1589. when griefe, rage, and furie of the laſt troubles beganne, you ſhall find, that the number of their confeſſions was infinitely encreaſed, and ſpecially in the Colledge of the Ieſuits at Paris. <hi>Totius vitae confeſſiones auditae trecentae.</hi> Wee haue heare 300. totall confeſſions, wrote the Subſtitutes of the Colledge to their Generall <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiua.</hi> If you aske me whence this new deuotion of the common people to them proceeded, I wil tell you. Our Kings repreſent the true image of God: Againſt whom this yeere there hapned three ſtraunge and vnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall accidents; firſt, the rebellion againſt the late king, which they coloured with the title, and pretext of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: for the faireſt title they could affoord him, was the name of Tyrant: ſecondly, the parricide committed vppon his perſon by a Munke: and laſtly, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of that rebellion, againſt the King that now is, for his religion.</p>
               <p>Be you aſſured, that all ſuch, as did not hold their conſciences at as low a rate, as many of the Cleargie
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14558:180"/>doe, found themſelues much diſquieted vpon theſe accidents. Which was the cauſe, that during theſe troubles, they went to be confeſt by theſe vpſtart Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries, ſome were to be reſolued by them, whether it were ſin not to yeeld obedience to their King, others to be abſolued for the ſame. But this was to commit the Lambe to the Woolues cuſtodie: for their confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were as many inſtructions, or rather deſtructions, to teach Rebellion: refuſing to abſolue them, which eyther were not in their conſciences fully confirmed in their reuolt from the two Kings, or had any inclination to acknowledge them for their Soueraignes. And, (which is full of horrour and deteſtation) their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie courſe was, before they would abſolue them, to make them ſweare by the holy Goſpell contayned in their breuiaries, neuer to take theſe two Kings for their lawfull Soueraignes.</p>
               <p>That which I ſpeake, I haue by good information from many, that were fayne to paſſe through that ſtrait, and I know one amongſt the reſt, more neere mee then the reſt, who rather then hee would giue credit to their doctrine, departed from his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, without receiuing abſolution. This teacheth to the whole bodie of the Realme. But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning priuate Families, the Ieſuits make a double vſe of miniſtring Confeſſion: One is, to take information from the Penitent, not onely of his owne ſinnes, but of their demeanour likewiſe that dwell with him, or with whom hee dwelleth; nay of the whole neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoode: as if it were a ſinne in him, not to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer an other mans ſinne in confeſſion, eyther if hee know it, or ſuppoſe that he knowes it. Which is as much in effect, as to make ſo many ſpies and carrie-tales in a Towne, as there be Ieſuits Confeſſors. The ſecond vſe, which toucheth them in a neerer reſpect, is,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:181"/>that in ſucking by the eare the ſoule of a timorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they ſucke or rather ſwallow there-withall his goods, and poſſeſſions: by promiſing abundance of Spirituall goods in the world to come after their death, to thoſe that ſhall, in their life time, be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to them out of their temporall goods. A courſe whereby they haue carried away an infinite maſſe of wealth, if you beleeue thoſe, that haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vppon them to write their Legend; for I know not by what other name to in title the liues of theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers.</p>
               <p>One point more I will adde (whereof I deſire to be reſolued by our auucient Doctors in Diuinitie) they haue a rule in practiſe, that men are bound to accuſe themſelues to their Confeſſour, and not themſelues onely, but all their confederates likewiſe, and (as for the Magiſtrate) the malefactor being condemned to die, after he hath once made confeſſion of his ſinnes to his ghoſtly father, is not tyed to reueale it to his Iudge: nay it is lawfull for him to ſtand in ſtiffe deniall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, at the time of his execution, as being cleere before God (although he perſiſt in a lie) after he hath once diſcharged the depth of his conſcience to his Confeſſor. A thing that breedeth much ſcruple in the minde of a Iudge, who otherwiſe is greatly quieted in conſcience, when an offender adiudged to die, howſoeuer he haue before time ſtood in deniall of the fact, yet at the time of his death confeſſeth the truth.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 14.</hi> ¶ Whether the Ieſuits haue Spaniſh harts, as their enemies charge them to haue, or if they be, for Who giues most.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Heare many thunder againſt the Ieſuits, charging them to be Spaniſh in hart and affection; they on the otherſide, ſeeme to feare nothing more, then to incurre thys opinion in Fraunce. I purpoſe preſentlie to deliuer them of this feare, and for a neede to become their Aduocate in this poynt, not ſo much for the good affection I beare them, as that the truth enioynes mee thereunto. It's true they fauoured the Spaniſh procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, about the middle and end of our troubles, (which makes them feare leaſt the memorie thereof ſhould be reuiued) but that their harts are Spaniſh, I vtterly deny. It proceeded not of any eſpeciall deuotion, which they had to the late King of Spayne, more then to any other Prince, but for that (following the courſe of Ieſuits, who meaſure the right and iuſtice of a cauſe, by the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of theyr owne affaires) they deuote themſelues v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually to him, whom they ſuppoſe to haue the ſtrongeſt partie, and from whom they ſtand in expectation of greateſt commoditie, which is no ſmall ſecret in matters of ſtate, for them which in their harts ſtand neutrall, &amp; indifferent.</p>
               <p>The ſame leſſon was likewiſe put in practiſe in time of our laſt troubles, by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fiſt, a man of as great wiſedome &amp; gouernment, as euer came in Rome. Such was the contagion of thoſe times, after the death
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14558:183"/>of the two Brothers at Blois, that certaine young Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, infected with the poyſon of the Ieſuits, looſed the reines to ſubiects againſt their King, in the yeere 1589. notwithſtanding, themſelues confeſſed at that time, that their aduiſe in this poynt ought not to take place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the formall confirmation of the Sea Apoſtolicke. Neuertheleſſe, <hi>Commolet</hi> the Ieſuit, and his adherents, the day following, ſounded the Trumpet of warre in their Pulpets, againſt the King deceaſed, affirming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that it was confirmed by Decree. Whereupon inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe outragious diſorders, which wee haue ſeene in Fraunce ſince that time. To take Armes againſt his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, was hereſie, but much greater hereſie was it, not to tarrie for the allowance, or diſallowance of the holy Sea. So that this was to offer violence to two So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne powers at once, the ſpirituall power of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall Sea, and the temporall power of the King. And Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> if hee had pleaſed, might with one ſtroake of his pen haue extinguiſht all our troubles, by exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating all thoſe, who without his knowledge &amp; authoritie, had preſumed to arme themſelues againſt their King, whom hee knewe to be a moſt deuout Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique. But he kept himſelfe well enough from that, for in ſo dooing, he ſhould haue exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated them, who at that time had all the ſtrength on their part, in fauour of a poore King, againſt whom, heauen &amp; earth ſeemed to conſpire. Contrariwiſe, he conuented him to Rome, to anſwer that he had done, againſt al the lawes. cuſtoms, liberties, and priuiledges of our Countrie of Fraunce.</p>
               <p>Our King now raigning, was at his firſt comming to the Crowne, of a contrarie religion to ours, and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Pope at the firſt to cenſure him for ſuch a one: but when hee once came to knowe his valour, and that his enemies did but feede his holineſſe with falſe bruits of imaginarie victories, he began to ſhrink his head out
<pb facs="tcp:14558:184"/>of the coller, and would neuer after haue any hand in the matter. And from that day forward, vſed the King vnderhand with all the curteſie that coulde be deſired. Neither doe you thinke for all this, that <hi>Sixtus</hi> ſtood the worſe affected to the King that dead is, or the better to him that now raigneth, but he thereby out of his vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, fauoured the more his owne proceedings. Albeit certaine fooliſh Schollers charged him a little before his death, that hee was inclined to the Kings partie: And vppon this challenge, ſome raſh ſpirits haue not ſpared to ſay, that he was poyſoned: whereunto I will giue no credite, although it were true.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of our Ieſuits, who ayme at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the aduauncement of theyr Common-wealth, which they entitle, <hi>The Societie of Ieſus:</hi> which as it hath take his originall and increaſe from nothing but from the Troubles; ſo doe they ſhoote at nothing, but to diſturbe thoſe countries wherein they remaine, &amp; in that diſturbance, they euer encline to thoſe which are able to maiſter the weaker part, as I will make good by an ocular demonſtration.</p>
               <p>After they had ſet fire to the foure corners and midſt of Fraunce, and that the late King was brought to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtraight, they deuoted themſelues to him aboue the reſt that was the Captaine generall of the League, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all things fell happilie on his ſide. And as long as Fortune ſmiled vppon him, all theyr Sermons vvere of nothing but his greatnes and merrits. But when they once perceiued that hee beganne to decline, and that he was forced to call to the King of Spayne for aſſiſtance, then beganne they likewiſe to turne theyr face from the Duke, wedding themſelues to the partie of a King, whom they eſteemed to be exceeding mightie.</p>
               <p>There is at this day a new King in Spayne, what his good or ill fortune ſhall be, is knowne to GOD one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. For my part, it ſhall neuer grieue me, to ſee as many
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14558:184"/>Crownes on his heade, as were on his Fathers, the late deceaſed King. Imagine, that for a new opinion of war, (vvhich is eaſily harboured in the braine of a young Prince) he ſhould breake with vs, and that our affaires ſhould haue proſperous ſucceſſe in his dominions, bee aſſured you ſhould ſee our Ieſuits altogether French, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they were Spaniards by birth. Theſe are true birds of pray, that houer in the ayre.</p>
               <p>It was wel befitting the perſon of a ſoueraigne prince, to play that part which <hi>Sixtus</hi> did, but for a ſubiect it is an ill preſident, &amp; a matter of dangerous conſequence. This is to prooue, that which way ſoeuer you turne your thoughts, you ſhall finde no reaſon, why the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits ſhould be nouriſht within a kingdome, who are as many (I will not ſay eſpialls, but) enemies to theyr Prince, if he fortune to prooue the weaker. And for a neede, if there ſhould happen newe factions in Rome, and that the Pope were put to the worſt, hee himſelfe ſhould feele the effects thereof, notwithſtanding the particuler homage, which they ſweare vnto him at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie change of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the Aduocate finiſht this diſcourſe, but the Gentleman replyed, Take heede you be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that this your poſition doe not imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For if the Ieſuit bee naturallie addicted to him, that is, moſt beneficiall to him, as you hold, then muſt it of conſequence followe, that hee is naturally Spaniſh, and not French. VVill you know the cauſe? hee is ſure, that what trouble ſoeuer hee may breede in the conſciences of theſe, and theſe priuate men, by his nevve kinde of confeſſions, yet ſhall hee neuer be able to get ſuch footing in the whole Realme of Fraunce, as hee hath alreadie in Spayne, wherein the ſupreame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is fallen from one extremitie into another. For the Spaniards, beeing of olde accuſed to be halfe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, as holding a mungrell Religion, and not wholie
<pb facs="tcp:14558:185"/>Chriſtian, doe novve in theſe dayes, to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of that calumnious accuſation, (for ſo I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be) they ſpeciallie, and aboue all others, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Ieſuits, eſteeming them vaſſales to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, without all clauſe or exception. And vpon thys opinion, they graunt them in theyr Citties, an infinite number of prerogatiues, aboue the common people, yea, euen aboue the Magiſtrates themſelues, whom they rule at their pleaſures.</p>
               <p>And albeit antiquitie haue giuen vs in Fraunce, the title of the eldeſt ſonnes to the Catholique Apoſtolick Romane Church, yet is it with certaine qualifications, vvhich the Ieſuits ſhall neuer be able to remoue out of our heads, what ſoeuer ſhewe of continuation they bring to the contrarie. And that is the cauſe, why they, ſuppoſing their commoditie vvould be greater, if the Spaniard were Maiſter of all Fraunce, then at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it is, will euermore leane to that ſide, rather then to ours, albeit they were naturally French. Theſe are pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians, which cleaue rather to the certaine, then to the vncertaine.</p>
               <p>Thinke not your ſelfe interrupted by thys ſhort Parentheſis, but if you pleaſe, fall againe into your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. I will doe ſoe (aunſwered the Aduocate) and I vvill tell you a ſtrange thing, which I haue obſerued in all their practiſes.</p>

This Princeſſe was a moſt zealous Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and was mightily bent, to take an order with the Puritans of England, their Queene being once gone, who had none neerer of blood to ſucceede her, then the Queene of Scots. As then the Ieſuits in the yeere 1582. ſtirred the minds of great perſonages, inciting them to take Armes, ſo did Father <hi>Henrie Sammier</hi> their Embaſſadour, goe ouer into England, to trouble the State there. He was then in the habite of a ſouldier, in a doublet of Orenge tawny Satten, cut and drawne out with greene Taffata, a caſe of piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols at his ſaddle bow, his ſword by his ſide, and a Scarfe about his necke. I haue it from them, that were not farre from his company. Thus attired as he was, hee practiſed a ſecret reuolt with certain Catholique Lords, againſt their Queene, which afterwards coſt them deere by the wiſedome of the Lord Treaſurer.</p>
               <p>After that, he fell in with the Queene of Scots, bearing her in hand, that hee, and thoſe of his Societie, treated with all the Catholique Princes, as well for the reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of Catholique Religion in England, as alſo for
<pb facs="tcp:14558:186"/>the libertie of this poore deſolate Princeſſe, coniuring her by all manner of obteſtations to liſten thereunto, and to diſpoſe all her ſeruants and ſubiects to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of ſo high an enterpriſe, aſſuring her for his part, to make good to her the Realme of England. This proiect he laid with her, but (as theſe Ieſuits haue naturally two hearts) he plotted farre otherwiſe with the aforeſaid Noble men of England, in the behalfe of a more puiſſant Prince, to defeat his poore Ladie of her future right, both he and his adherents diuerting the principall Catholiques from the ſeruice, which they had vowed to this Princeſſe, ſignifying vnto them, that her meanes was too weake and feeble, for them to build any hope of riſing thereupon. And accordingly about the ſame time, did the Ieſuits publiſh in print, the title which that other Prince pretended to the Crowne of England. Which libel they diſperſed in ſundrie places of Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>And albeit this was the principall marke they ſhot at, yet did not <hi>Sammier</hi> deſiſt to follow the ſaid Queene tooth and nayle. At the firſt hearing whereof, ſhe ſeemed to pauſe, foreſeeing the miſchiefe that might enſue: whereupon the audacious Ieſuit ſaid vnto her, that if ſhe were ſo cold in the matter, he knew a meanes, how to cut off both her, and the King of Scotland her ſonne from all hope of England for euer: and that it was a clauſe in his inſtructions: <hi>quod ſi molesta fuiſſet, nec illa, nec filius eius regnarent.</hi> Inſomuch as ſhe was conſtrayned to yeeld thereunto. And at that time the late Duke of Guiſe, not knowing of the factions and partialities which theſe men wrought vnder hand in behalfe of the other Prince, promiſed to be wholly for the Queene his Cooſen. And certainely I make no queſtion, but hee as a noble and valiant Prince, would haue gone thorow withall, had not the Ieſuits engaged him in another new quarrell: which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14558:186"/>on the one ſide, and on the other forſaking his Cooſens, was left in the lurch in the end. The Queene vpon the firſt intelligence of this new deſigne, ſhedding aboundant teares, and falling vpon her knees, cried out: Wo is me, for both my cooſen, and my ſelfe are aſſurdly vndone. In this meane time the troubles ſet footing, in England by the practiſes of the Ieſuit: the Scottiſh Queenes conſpiracies were diſcouered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe wanted a head: the law proceeded againſt diuers: the poore Catholiques, which till that time were not moleſted for their conſciences, were forced to forſake their wiues and children, and to leaue their houſes, to auoid the Magiſtrates ſeueritie. Moreouer, <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> who was executed in 84. confeſt, that the murther of the Queene of England, which he had conſpired, was to eſtabliſh the Scottiſh Queene in her throne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſhe were not priuie to this plot: which confeſſion of his, made the Queene and Counſell of England to ſtart, and to ſtand better vpon their guards.</p>
               <p>In concluſion the Scottiſh Queens proceſſe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced &amp; proſecuted to effect, ſhe was adiudged by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to loſe her head, &amp; not long after died a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick with meruailous reſolution. By this you may collect, that the Ieſuits were the ſole contriuers of her death: and that they are ſo farre from hauing eſtabliſhed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion in England, that contrariwiſe, by their meanes, both it hath beene quite baniſht, and a number of great and worſhipfull houſes brought to vtter ruine and deſtruction. By reaſon whereof they haue confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the erronious doctrine of the Puritans, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thoſe of our religion, of all hope, to ſet in foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, vnleſſe it be by ſpeciall miracle from heauen.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 16.</hi> ¶ That the Ieſuits entermedling in matters of State, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue troubled whole Realmes, yet doe all things fall out quite contrarie to their expectation.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen our Sauiour Chriſt taught vs, that we ſhould giue vnto God, that which belonged vnto him, and to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Rome, his right likewiſe, his meaning was, that paying the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour his tribute, we ought alſo to giue God his, and in regard of him not to exceed the limits of our calling. By which reaſon, the good and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſon, ought to giue himſelfe wholly to faſting, prayer, and heating of Sermons. I know, that the kings of this land, doe ſometimes call Prelates to be of their Councell, according as their owne diſpoſition leads them, or as they finde thoſe perſons meet and able for the place, yet doth it not therefore follow, that they ſhould make that a generall rule, and preſident for the whole Clergie.</p>
               <p>Were not the ſpirit of Diuiſion, otherwiſe called the Diuell, ſeated within the breaſts of Ieſuits, I would ſay, that there was neuer wiſer Decree made, then that of their Synode, in the yeere 1593. whereby they were prohibited to meddle in State affaires: not only becauſe it is forbidden by God (for that is the leaſt part of their care) but for that in reaſoning the matter, as a Stateſ-man, I cannot ſee that euer they brought their practiſes to thoſe ends which they aymed at. They are like a March Sunne, which ſtirreth humors in our bodies, but is to weake to diſpatch and diſſolue them. I will goe further, ſuch is their ill fortune, that if they fauour any partie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue ſhuffled the cards al they can, yet when the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14558:187"/>game is at an end, he whoſe part they take, euermore prooues the looſer. Inſomuch, as albeit to humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Ieſuit may ſeeme to be an enemie of ſome value, yet ſo it is, that by Gods ſecret iudgement, it is more for our profit to haue him our enemie, then our friend. I will prooue it by fiue or ſixe notable examples.</p>
               <p>They went about to make alteration in the State of England, and to that end bent all their ſtrength: what followed of that their enterpriſe? the ruine of a number of poore Catholiques miſſe-led by them, which before time liued at eaſe in their owne houſes: the death of the Scottiſh Queene, the eſtabliſhing of the Queene of England for a long time both in her Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; eſtate.</p>
               <p>I come next vnto Scotland, as being next in place to England, where Father <hi>William Crichton,</hi> and <hi>Iames Gourdon,</hi> both Scots by birth, had their reſidence, <hi>Crich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> tooke a conceit, vpon ſome diſcontentment, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the land: he takes his courſe directly into Spayne, by the licence, and permiſſion of his Generall. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is no ſooner come, but he practiſeth to inſinuate himſelfe into the Kings fauour: and to that effect, drawes a tree of the deſcent, and petigree of the <hi>Infanta</hi> his daughter, ſhewing therein that the Crownes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scotland, did by right appertain vnto her: and to incite him the rather to take armes againſt the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh King, he ſcattred abroad diffamatorie libels againſt him. Whereunto the King of Spayne giuing no eare, <hi>Crichton</hi> determined with himſelfe, by letters to ſollicite the Catholick nobility of Scotland to the ſame purpoſe; and to that end, wrote letters in the yeere 1592. to <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and other Ieſuits remayning in Scotland, whereby he gaue them to vnderſtand, in what grace he was with the King, who by his incitement was reſolued, aſwell for the inuaſion of England, as for the reſtoring of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent religion in Scotland. But this mightie Prince, deſired to haue aſſurance before hand from the Catholique
<pb facs="tcp:14558:188"/>Lords of their good affection towards him, from whom he willed them to procure blanks readie ſigned, to be ſupplied afterwards by himſelfe with deputations in their names, which being obtained, he had the Kings promiſe for two hundred, and fiftie thouſand crownes, which ſhould be ſent ouer to be diſtributed amongſt them. The Ieſuits of Scotland, vpon this aduertiſement, drew many blanks from diuers perſons, which they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to <hi>George Ker</hi> to carrie, who being diſcouered by the folly and indiſcretion of <hi>Robert Albercromi</hi> a Ieſuit, was apprehended with his letters and blanks: and the Scottiſh King, ſuppoſing this aduertiſement giuen by <hi>Crichton</hi> to be true indeed, cauſed the Baron of Fentree, a Gentleman endued with many good parts, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. The like had hapned to the Earle of Anguis, the chiefe Earle of that country, if he had not cunningly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped out of priſon. After, in continuance of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, his Caſtles were ruinated, as alſo the Earle of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, a man of the greateſt power of them all, &amp; the Earle of Arrols, the Conſtable of Scotland. All which, ſince that time, haue made profeſſion of the pretended refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion, as wel to returne into fauor with the king, as to liue within their owne countrey in ſecuritie of their goods, &amp; perſons. Inſomuch, as in concluſion, Scotland hath loſt that ſmall remainder of our Catholique Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the yeere 1596.</p>
               <p>The like fell out as well in the Realme of Portugall, as of Arragon, I will firſt ſpeake of Portugall. To ſay that the Ieſuits procured the death of King <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> as ſome in their writings haue charged them, is hard to beleeue: for as <hi>Montaignes</hi> hath very well declared, they were too highly in his fauour. But marke the proceedings: among all the nations of Spaine, there is none ſo ſuperſtitious, as the Portugall, and of all the kings of Portugall, there was neuer any more ſuperſtitious then <hi>Sebaſtian.</hi> The Ieſuits being cunning, and ſubtle headed, thought this
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14558:188"/>to be a fit ſoyle for them to plant their vineyard in. And to win the more credit, they cauſed themſelues at their firſt comming, to be called, not Ieſuits, but Apoſtles, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues in rank with thoſe, that followed our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt in perſon. A title thich they hold as yet in that place, as being generally aſſented to. The kingdome being fallen to <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> theſe holy Apoſtles conceiued a hope, that by his means it might deſcend vnto their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, &amp; dealt with him many times, that no man might from thence forward, be capable of the Crown of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, except he were a Ieſuit, &amp; choſen by their Society, as at Rome the Pope is by the Colledge of Cardinals. And for as much as he (although as ſuperſtitious, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition it ſelfe) could not, or rather durſt not condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend thereunto, they perſwaded him, that God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in ſhould be ſo, as himſelfe ſhould vnderſtand by a voice from heauen neere the Sea ſide. Inſomuch as this poore Prince, thus caried away, reſorted to the place two or three ſeuerall times, but they could not play their parts ſo well, as to make him heare this voice. They had not as yet got into their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, their impoſtor <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> who in Rome fained himſelfe to be infected with a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie. Theſe Ieſuits ſeeing thy could not that way at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the marke they ſhot at, yet would they not ſo leaue it. This King being in heart a Ieſuit, determined to lead a ſingle life. Therefore to bring themſelues into neerer employment about him, they councelled him to vndertake a iourny for the conqueſt of the kingdom of Feſſe, where he was ſlaine in a pitcht field, loſing both his life and his kingdome together. This then is the fruite which King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> reapt by giuing credit to the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its. And this which I haue here diſcourſed vnto you: I had fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the late Marques of Piſani, an earneſt Catholick, who was then Embaſſador for the king of France in the Spaniſh kings Court. I omit all that hath ſince paſſed in that Realme, as being impertinent to my diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>I come vnto that which hath ſince hapned within the Realme of Arragon: wherein you ſhall ſee the like accidents by the indiſcreet dooing of the Ieſuits. The people of Arragon, had in their foundation from all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, verie great priuiledges againſt the abſolute power of their kings: and the oath of fealty, which they tendered their King at his Coronation ranne thus. <hi>Nos qui valemos tanto come vos, y podemos mas que vos, vos elegemos Rëy, con estas y estas conditiones intra vos y nos, que el á vn que manda mas que vos.</hi> That is: We that are as great in dignitie as you, and of greater power then you, doe elect you our King, with this and this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between you and vs, that there ſhal be one amongſt vs, who ſhall commaund aboue you. And vnder that, they ſpecified all their priuiledges, which the King promiſed by oath to obſerue moſt exactly.</p>
               <p>Theſe liberties hauing beene infringed in the perſon of <hi>Antonio de Peréz,</hi> their countriman, and Secretary of Eſtate to the late King of Spayne, he eſcaping out of priſon, wherein he had beene long detayned in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile, takes his way to Arragon, where hee recounts the wrongs that had beene done him, to the preiudice of the auncient priuiledges, and liberties of their countrey. His complaint was generally applauded by all, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the Ieſuits, who inwardly reioyce at any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of trouble and commotion. They begin by their confeſſions, (one of their chiefe weapons) to winne the hearts of diuers ſubiects, againſt their King, in Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa, the mother Citie of the Realme, giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to riſe vp in armes, &amp; in this heat euerie man betakes himſelfe to his weapons. The king of Spayne on his part, armeth himſelfe in like manner. The Ieſuits ſeeing the forces of the Arragonians on foot, readie to put themſelues into the field, to encounter the kings power, they turning their coates, began by their ſermons, and confeſſions to runne a new courſe.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:14558:190"/>
               <p>There was no more talking of priuiledges, they made no reckoning of the world, but of their conſciences to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, who commaunded them preciſely to liue in obedience to their King: that if they would ſubmit themſelues vnto him, he would take them to mercie: a thing whereof they were well aſſured, hauing Letters ſigned by him to that effect.</p>
               <p>Vpon this promiſe of theyrs, ſome particuler per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons retyre themſelues to the Kings Lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and obtaine their pardon. By whoſe example ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie others doe the like. By this meanes, the Armie of the Arragonians is diſſolued of it ſelfe. The King of Spaynes forces enter Sarragoſſa, without any ſtroake ſtrooken, where they beginne to play theyr parts, they pull downe diuers houſes to the ground, as well of the Cittie as of the Countrie, put the chiefe of the Nobility to death, raiſe a Citadell within the Towne, and put a garriſon into it. And ſince that time, the King of Spaine hath commaunded there abſolutely, as hee doth in the reſt of his dominions.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are ill affected to the Ieſuits, giue out, that they ſowed the firſt ſeedes of this rebellion, by a double carriage of the matter vnderhand, which kinde of dealing is very common and familiar with them. If that be true, they are the more to be condemned. I, for my part, who am enclined to iudge the beſt, impute it wholy to theyr ſimplicitie, and that in medling in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtate, wherein (God wot) they are but Nouices, they ouerthrow thoſe, that fondly giue eare vnto them. Wherunto the gentleman replying; I am not (ſaith he) of their number, that wiſh them ill, for they neuer deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ill of me, yet I make no queſtion, but when they incited the Arragonians to reuolt, it was but a iugling trick, to further the King of Spaines intendments. For, as you know much better then my ſelfe, Kings are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times well pleaſed with ſuch rebellions, that they
<pb facs="tcp:14558:191"/>may thereby take occaſion to ſuppreſſe, and reſtraine the auncient priuiledges of theyr ſubiects, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into euen ranke with theyr fellowes. And this leades me, perſiſting in my former opinion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue more and more, that the Ieſuit beares a Spaniſh hart, that is, a hart naturally deuoted to the King of Spaine. Beſides, if you take this Arragonian hiſtorie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in that ſence, yet ſhould your rule fall ſhort: for this practiſe of theirs, fell out moſt ſucceſſefully vnto them.</p>
               <p>The Aduocate made aunſwere to the Gentleman, ſaying: The matter is not great, you may conceiue of it as pleaſe your ſelfe: as for mee, I am of another minde, &amp; I am perſwaded my opinion comes neerer the truth. But not to digreſſe from the matter in hand, you ſhall finde no hiſtorie more ſtrange, as touching the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in queſtion, then that which of late memorie hath happened to the King of Poland, <hi>Stephen Batori,</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo King of Sweden. This Prince being altogether Ieſuited, and hauing beene mightily importuned by them, to be admitted into his Realme of Sweden, at laſt reſolued to ſatisfie their deſire. His ordinarie reſidence is in Poland, and for Sweden, Duke <hi>Charles</hi> his Vncle, is his Lieutenant generall. The King, deſirous to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh what the Ieſuits requeſted, ſignified his pleaſure directly to his vncle: <hi>Charles</hi> made him aunſwere, that the people would neuer be brought to like of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, and beſought the King his nephew, not to grow into termes with his ſubiects, to whom he had giuen his promiſe, at the time of his coronation, neuer to receiue the Ieſuits into his Realme; wherunto the chiefe States of the Land had likewiſe ſubſcribed.</p>
               <p>But he, that ſaw not, but by their eyes, &amp; heard not, but by their eares, reſolued to goe thorow withall, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe humble admonitions) and to enter his realme with an Armie, to make his ſubiects belieue that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14558:191"/>he meant good earneſt: for preuenting whereof, they arme themſelues likewiſe on their part. The matter was ſo carried, that the Prince was firſt ouerthrowne by ſea, afterwards diſcomfited by Land, and taken priſoner: within a while after, he was ſet at libertie, and reſtored to his Crowne, vnder promiſe to call a Parliament, and to obſerue, what ſhould therein be concluded and agreed vpon.</p>
               <p>The States were ſummoned, he in time of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, conueyed himſelfe away, leauing garriſons in certaine places, which were at his deuotion. Beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe againe to Polande, by the inſtigation of the Ieſuits, who wholy poſſeſt him, hee gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſcattered boordes of his ſhipwrackt Armie, &amp; implores ayde of the States of Poland, to reuenge the wrong which he ſayd was done him.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, while hee was about his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (as yet he is, the Polanders lending a deafe eare to the matter) his vncle tooke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him thoſe places, which were remaining in his ſubiection within Sweden, and is at the poynt, to put him quite beſides his kingdome, which was gotten by the proweſſe of <hi>Gustaue</hi> his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and kept by the wiſedome of his Father; Poland beeing not very firme to him withall. And for all thys his fall and ouerthrow, he may thanke none but the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, whoſe protection he would needs vndertake.</p>
               <p>After I haue trauailed into all theſe farre Countries, I will returne to mine owne. The Ieſuits raiſed troubles in the ſtate of Fraunce, vnder pretence to roote Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme out of the land. In this quarrell the Spaniard was called to for aſſiſtance, who entertained no meane hopes, ſeeing himſelfe commaund within Paris with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen armes, and aboue all other, fauoured by the Ieſuits, who had the whole rule and ſuperintendencie ouer that Anarchie, or confuſed gouernment of the ſixteene Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, ſet vp by the multitude.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14558:192"/>
               <p>I will not ſay what the departure of the Spaniard was, this I will ſay, that the Kings entrance into Paris was ſo tryumphant, as the Spaniard thought himſelfe happie, that he might hold his life of him by fealtie &amp; homage. Moreouer, the trayterous practiſes of the Ieſuits, which vaniſhed into ſmoake, were the occaſion, that by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made in the high court of Paris, themſelues vvere baniſht and expelled, as well out of the good Cittie of Paris, as out of the iuriſdiction of that Court.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I ſee not after they haue raiſed tumults in all Countries, that theyr deſignements ſort to effect.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14558:193"/>the kingdome, &amp; annoint Dauid king.</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>Oſias</hi> king of Iuda, the high prieſt (no more a GOD then <hi>Samuell,</hi>) gaue the kingdome from the father to the ſonne, he being ſtrooken with leproſie for his preſumption. This tranſpoſition of the Crowne, was doone by the appointment of the high Prieſt, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as by the Law was ordained) and conſequently the depoſition of the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iehoiada</hi> was no God, but a prieſt, and Gods Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt, when, after he had cauſed <hi>Athalia</hi> the Queene to be put to death for her tyrannous gouernment, hee put the ſcepter into the handes of <hi>Ioas,</hi> a prince of the blood, and lawfull ſucceſſor to the Crowne. All thoſe were but Gods miniſters to execute his decrees, as the Pope likewiſe is.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing God hath infinite meanes to tranſlate a kingdome, by the force and weapons of Pagans, as of Moores, Turks, and other ſtrange Nations, making the Aſſyrians conquerours ouer the Greekes, the Greekes ouer the Aſſyrians, both of the Iewes, and the Romans of both, what milder courſe could he haue ordained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, what way more reaſonable, or more ſecure, then by the mediation and authoritie of the head of the Church, and the common Father of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who beeing ſpecially aſſiſted by God, and by men both learned and religious, will in likelihood doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preiudiciall to the right of the lawfull ſucceſſors, and will proceede without paſſion, and withall mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and mildnes in a caſe of that importance, hauing an eye euermore to the honour of God, and vnto the publique and priuate good.</p>
               <p>In concluſion, by this learned poſition, which our pernitious Ieſuit maintaines, the Pope hath authoritie to transferre kingdoms fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one hand to another, when he ſeeth cauſe ſo to doe, and dooing it, hee is ſubiect to no mans controule: inaſmuch as if God himſelfe may
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14558:193"/>doe it, then is it lawfull for his Vicar to doe the like: the Pope hauing no leſſe preheminence ouer Kings, in theſe times of Chriſtianity, then the Prophets had in the time of Moſes law.</p>
               <p>This fond opinion of thine, brings mee to a meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtraite, forcing mee to combate againſt the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the holie Sea. Firſt, if you will argue this poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on morallie, where ſhall you finde that a King conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting his Lieuetenants generall in Prouinces, giueth them in all poynts as ample authoritie, as himſelfe hath ouer his ſubiects? And to ſay, that God hath transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his omnipotent power into any man whatſoeuer, is a poynt of blaſpemie againſt the Maieſtie of GOD. Beſides, tell mee Sophiſter, where finde you that you ought to beg ſuch examples out of the old Teſtament, to tranſplant them into the new?</p>
               <p>But with ſuch illuſions doe you and your aſſociats, ſurpriſe the conſciences of the weake &amp; ignorant mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. For if that reaſon of yours were of any value, or conſequence, we ſhould by the ſame, bring Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion into vſe againe at this day, becauſe it was vſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And by the ſame pretext, it ſhall be lawfull for the ſubiect, to lay violent handes vppon his Soueraigne,<note place="margin">Iudges. 3.</note> becauſe <hi>Ehud</hi> murthered <hi>Eglon</hi> King of Moab, vnpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>Seeing you terme your ſelfe a Ieſuit, let vs follow the footeſteps of Ieſus Chriſt; for to this marke ought all our cogitations to leuell, whereunto reſtraining our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I will make it appeare, that I am a true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke liegeman to the Pope, and thou a true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Impoſtor. VVee conſider the power of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt in two different times: one was, vvhen for our Redemption hee deſcended from heauen into the earth: the other, vvhen after his death and paſſion, hee aſcended from earth into heauen. The firſt was the time of his humilitie, in reſpect whereof hee profeſſed,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:194"/>that his comming was not to be an vmpire of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, which they would haue referred to him: at what time he diſtinguiſht the power of God, from the power of the Romane Emperour, ſaying; That wee muſt yeeld vnto God, that which belonged vnto God, and vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that which was due vnto <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And being demaunded of <hi>Pilate,</hi> whether he were a king or no, he made him aunſwere, that his kingdome was not of this inferiour world. The ſecond was the time of his glorie, whereunto all thoſe excellent ſayings of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid are to be referred: as when he ſaid, that the earth was the Lords: <hi>Aske of mee, and I will giue thee nations and heritages, and they ſhall be vnto thee for a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion vnto the vttermost bounds of the earth.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, that hee was <hi>Lorde of Lordes, and King of Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs not falſifie the holie Scripture: For the more you ambitious Ieſuits apply out of it to the Pope, to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe, not his greatnes, but your owne, the more you take from him. At what time did Chriſt aſſigne Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to be his Vicar? Surely while hee was yet on earth, and at the poynt to finiſh his pilgrimage, that he might repreſent his perſon heere below, in his eſtate of humilitie: and ſo gaue him the keyes of heauen, &amp; not of earth, to ſignifie vnto vs, that he gaue him the charge of ſpirituall matters, without mingling there-withall temporall buſines.</p>
               <p>And certainly our auncient Popes were very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, if giuing them-ſelues the title of <hi>Seruus ſeruo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> they meant to repreſent Ieſus Chriſt, as hee is in the fulneſſe of his glorie, and after hee aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, to ſit on the right hand of GOD his Father. In like manner was it an hereſie in <hi>Luther,</hi> to teach his folowers, that the Pope was wrongfully termed head of the church, &amp; Vicar general to Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; no leſſe hereſie was it in <hi>Ignacius,</hi> when to oppoſe <hi>Luther,</hi> hee
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14558:194"/>affirmed that the Pope was Chriſts Vicar, not onely in his eſtate of humility, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his eſtate of glory like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Hee then is a true Catholique liegeman to the Pope, who doth acknowledge and approue his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, according to the originall inſtitution thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any augmentations, or additions from men.</p>
               <p>Ieſuit, I now come vnto thee: let vs weigh how ful of danger this poſition of thine is. Our Kings know beſt, what is expedient for the maintenance &amp; preſeruation of their eſtate: and like skilful Pilots, are faine ſomtimes to ſtrike ſayle in a tempeſt. This courſe the Pope, being carried away with other reſpects, will not like of, &amp; will perhaps ſummo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our kings to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>form their proceedings to his mind. After ſome two, or three admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, if they obey not, he wil proceed to cenſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to make a diuorce between them &amp; their ſubiects: or if not ſo, to interdite the Realm, &amp; expoſe it for a pray to any Prince, that ſhal be firſt able to poſſeſſe himſelfe of it. Good God! into what a confuſion doſt thou bring our State?</p>
               <p>Ieſuit, learne this leſſon of me; for I wil not ſuffer, either our countrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be infected with thy poyſonous propoſitions, or ſtraungers that ſhal read this booke of thine, to conceiue, that the Maieſtie of our kings is, by thy comming, any whit empayred. Firſt we maintayne, and vphold it for an article inuiolable in Fraunce, that the Pope hath no authority, to be liberal of our Realme, for any mans aduantage whatſoeuer, what fault ſoeuer our king ſhall be found culpable of, none excepted. The Pope hath no power, but what is giuen him by commiſſion from God; he is neither that <hi>Samuel,</hi> nor that <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> who were commaunded by God to doe, what they did vnder the olde law: for vnder the new, which we call the new Teſtament, there is no mention of any ſuch matter. The Pope cannot by the power of his ſpirituall ſword, controule the temporall. I ſay not
<pb facs="tcp:14558:195"/>therefore, that any king of Fraunce ſhould forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, eyther in the Catholique Religion, or in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of his ſubiects, to whom he ought to be a ſecond father: for if he doe, let him be aſſured, that God will ſooner, or later forget him, and auenge himſelfe by ſome meanes vnexpected, and vnthought of, but that we are to ſeeke this redreſſe at Rome, I flatly denie.</p>
               <p>For this firſt poſition, I hold it to be cleere: that which now I will deliuer, may ſeeme more queſtionable. We hold it for another article firme and indubitable in this Realme of Fraunce, that our kings are not ſubiect to the Popes excommunication. A thing, which we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from all antiquitie. I remember I haue read that <hi>Lothaire</hi> king of Auſtracia deceaſing, left <hi>Lewes</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was Emperour, and King of Italy, to be his ſucceſſor. King <hi>Charles, the Bald,</hi> vncle to them both, ſeazed on it by right of occupation, as lying fit for his hand. <hi>Lewes</hi> had recourſe to Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the quarrel for him, and ſummoned <hi>Charles</hi> to do his nephew right, vpon payne of excommunication: but <hi>Charles</hi> would giue no eare to him. By reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Pope went on to interpoſe his cenſures with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter curſes and comminations: and knowing the high authoritie, which reſted in <hi>Hingmare,</hi> Archbiſhoppe of Reims, he enioyned him not to admit the king, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with him, vpon paine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himſelfe to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his Holineſſe his communion.</p>
               <p>There was neuer Popes Iniunction, more iuſt, &amp; holy then this. For what colour could there be for an vncle to intercept his nephewes right in ſucceeding his owne brother? Yet neuer was I niunction worſe entertayned then this. For <hi>Hiagmare</hi> after he had imparted the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Apoſtolical to diuers Prelats and Barons of France, to be aduiſed by them, how to carry himſelfe in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he wrote backe to Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> what he had drawn and collected out of their aunſweres; namely, that all
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14558:195"/>of them were much offended, &amp; agreeued with that his Decree, alledging, that the like proceedings had not beene ſeene, no not when the kings were Heretiques, Sciſmatiques, or Tyrants: and maintayning that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes were purchaſed by the edge of the ſword, and not by the excommunications, or cenſures of the Sea Apoſtolique, or of Prelates. And when I vrge them (ſaid <hi>Hingmare</hi>) with the authoritie, which was dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by our Sauiour to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and from him deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by ſucceſſion to the Popes of Rome; they aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me. <hi>Petite Dominum Apostolicum vt: quia Rex &amp; Epiſcopus ſimul eſſe non poteſt: Et ſui anteceſſores Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiasticum ordinem (quod ſuum eſt) &amp; non Rempublicam (quod regum est) diſpoſuerunt. Non praecipiat nobis habere regem, qui nos in ſic longinquis partibus adiuuare non poſſit, contra ſubitaneos &amp; frequentes Paganorum impetus: &amp; nos Francos iubeat ſeruire, cui nolumus ſeruire. Qua iſtud iugu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſui anteceſſores, nostris anteceſſoribus non impoſueru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Quia ſcriptum in ſanctis libris audimus, vt pro libertate &amp; haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate nostra vſque ad mortem certare debeamus.</hi> That is, Tell our Apoſtolicall Lord, that he cannot at once be a King and a Prelate, and that his predeceſſors ordered the Eccleſiaſtical State (which belongeth vnto him) and not the temporall, (which pertaines only to kings.) Let him not inioyne vs to receiue a King, who remayning in a countrie ſo farre diſtant, cannot ayde vs, againſt the ſodain, &amp; ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incurſions of the Infidels. Neither let him commaund vs (who of our Franchiſe and Freedome beare the name of Franks) to ſerue him, whom we liſt not to ſerue: which yoake his predeceſſors neuer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vppon our Aunceſtors. And we finde it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in holy Scripture, that we ought to fight to the death, for our libertie and inheritance. <hi>And a little after, Propterea ſi Dominus Apoſtolicus vult pacem quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſic quaer at vt rixam non moueat.</hi> That is; Therefore if our Apoſtolicall Lord ſeeke after peace, let him ſo ſeeke
<pb facs="tcp:14558:196"/>it, as he be not an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of war. And in concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Hing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare</hi> ſhuts vp his letter with theſe words. <hi>Et vt mihi expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimento videtur, propter meam interdictionem, vel propter lingue humanae gladium, niſialiud obstiterit, Rex noster, vel eius Regni primores non dimittent, vt quod coeperunt, quaniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> potuerint, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exequantur.</hi> That is; And as I find by proofe, our King, or the Peeres of his Realme, are not minded, eyther for my excommunication, or the ſword of mans tongue (vnleſſe ſome other matter come to ſtop them) to deſiſt from proſecuting what they haue begun.</p>
               <p>By which letters you may vnderſtand, that the Pope tooke vpon him, not onely to cenſure King <hi>Charles, the Bald,</hi> for his diſobedience in ſo iuſt and rightfull a cauſe, but to make himſelfe Iudge alſo of Empyres and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: wherevnto neither the king, nor his ſubiects would euer aſſent: auouching, that the Pope could not confound Religion with State, and that they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to withſtand him, whatſoeuer it coſt them: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new law, which he meant to obtrude vpon the land, to the preiudice of our kings.</p>
               <p>It may be, ſome honeſt meaning man will ſay: How doth this hang together? You allow the Pope all prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and ſuperioritie in ſpirituall cauſes, and yet limite his general power in your owne king, though he ſhould runne aſtray out of the right way. For in reſpect of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, I grant it; but as for this high point of ſpirituall authority, all things make againſt that poſition. Whom I aunſwere thus. We acknowledge in Fraunce, that the Pope is ſupreame head of the Catholique and Vniuerſall Church, yet is it not therefore abſurd, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent, that our Kings ſhould be exempted from his cenſures.</p>
               <p>We ſee that all auncient Monaſteries, are naturallie ſubiect to the iuriſdiction of theyr Dioceſans, yet are many of them by ſpeciall priuiledge exempted from the ſame. Our auncient Kings haue beene the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14558:196"/>of the holy Sea, as well againſt the tyrannie of the Emperous of Conſtantinople, as againſt the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and inuaſions of the Lombards, which were dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie at the gates of Rome. One king alone, <hi>Pepin,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the whole ſtate, or Herarchie of Rauenna, which he freely gaue to the Pope, deliuering their Cittie from the long ſiege, which <hi>Astolpho</hi> king of the Lombards had held about it. And <hi>Charlemaine</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Pepin,</hi> chaſed out of Lombardie, <hi>Didier</hi> their king, and his whole race: making himſelfe Maiſter, as well of the Cittie of Rome, as of all Italie, where he was afterwards acknowledged, and crowned Emperour of the Weſt by Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> whom he reſtored fully and wholly to his auncient libertie, againſt the inſolencie of the people of Rome, who repined and mutined againſt him. And at that time was it concluded, that the Popes elect, might not enter vpon the exerciſe, or adminiſtration of theyr functions, vntill they were firſt confirmed by him or his ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>I am certainly perſwaded, that hee and his poſterity, were at that time freed, and exempted from all cenſures and excommunications of the holy Sea. And albeit we haue not the expreſſe Conſtitution to ſhew, yet may it be extracted out of the Ordinaunces of the ſaid Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, recorded by <hi>Iuon,</hi> Biſhop of Chartres: <hi>Si quos culpatores Regia potestas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 123. &amp; 195.</note> 
                  <hi>aut in gratiam benignitatis rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit, aut menſae ſuae participes fecerit, hos &amp; ſacerdotum, &amp; populorum conuentus ſuſcipere Eccleſiaſtica communione debebit, vt quod principalis pietas recepit, nec à Sacerdoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Dei extraneum habeatur.</hi> If the king ſhall receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinner into the fauour of his clemencie, or make him partaker of his owne table, the whole companie of the Prieſts and people, ſhall likewiſe receiue him into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the Church: that, that which the princes pietie hath admitted, be not by the prieſts, held as caſt off or reiected.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14558:197"/>
               <p>If then the table, or the fauour of our Kings, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite and abſolute the excommunicated perſon, from the Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, wee may well ſay, that our kings themſelues were exempt from all excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Our kings had right to confirme the Popes after their elections, a right which the Popes alledge, to haue beene by them remitted; then why ſhould we be more enuied then they, if the auncient Prelacie of Rome, haue priuiledged our kings from all excommunications and cenſures whatſoeuer?</p>
               <p>Sure I am that Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fourth, going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to infringe that prerogatiue, to gratifie the ſonnes of king <hi>Lewes the Milde,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> the good Biſhops and Prelats of Fraunce, ſent him vvord, that if he came in perſon to excommunicate their king, himſelfe ſhould returne excommunicated to Rome. A peremtorie ſpeech I muſt confeſſe, but it wrought ſo, as the Pope, to couer his packing, pretended hee came into Fraunce for no other intent, but to mediate a peace betweene the Father and the ſonnes, as indeede he did: and had he ſtood vppon other termes, hee would haue gone out of Fraunce greatly diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>So much doe wee embrace this priuiledge of our kings, as wee dare affirme, that it had his beginning ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Crowne it ſelfe, at what time <hi>Clouis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Chriſtian, or at leaſt in the ſecond line, within a while after our kings had taken in hand, the defence &amp; protection of the Church of Rome: for ſo doe we find it to haue beene obſerued ſucceſſiuely in <hi>Charlemaine, Lewes the Milde,</hi> his ſonne, and <hi>Charles the Balde,</hi> his grand-child. And ſince in the third line, when our kings ſeemed ſome what to forget the right way, and that it was requiſite to extend the authoritie of the Church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, the Pope, or his Legates, were fayne to ioyne the Clergie of Fraunce with them. In briefe, as long as all thinges were quiet and peaceable betweene
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14558:197"/>the King and his ſubiects, the cenſures of Rome were neuer receiued againſt our Kings.</p>
               <p>In our auncient Records, wee finde a Bull bearing date from Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eyght, the tenor whereof is, <hi>Vt nec Rex Franciae, nec Regina, nec liberi eorum ex communicart poſſint:</hi> That neyther the King nor the Queene of Fraunce, nor theyr chyldren can be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
               <p>It fell ſo out after that time, that the ſame Pope, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at variance with king <hi>Phillip the fayre,</hi> hee needes would excommunicate him, but there was neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication coſt Pope ſo deere, as that did him. For his <hi>Nuncios</hi> weare committed priſoners, his Buls burnt, and <hi>Boniface</hi> himſelfe, being taken by <hi>Naugeret,</hi> Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor of Fraunce, preſently after died, for very ſorrow &amp; deſpight that he had receiued ſo foule a diſgrace at the hands of his enemie. Wherein <hi>Phillip</hi> did nothing, but by the counſell and conſent of the whole Cleargie of Fraunce. So farre was this excommunication, from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the preiudice of the King and his Realme, that contrariwiſe, it turned to his ſhame and confuſion, by whom it was decreed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Benet</hi> the 13. otherwiſe called <hi>Peter de Luna,</hi> keeping his ſea or reſidence in Auignon, hauing interdited <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt and his realme, the king ſitting in the throne of iuſtice in the Parliament, or high Court of Paris, the 21. of May, 1408. gaue ſentence that the Bull ſhould be rent in peeces, and that <hi>Gonſalue</hi> &amp; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeloux,</hi> the bearers thereof, ſhould be ſet vpon a pillorie, and publiquely notified, and traduced in the pulpit: the meaning whereof was, that the people ſhould be taught and informed, that the king was not liable to any exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Which decree was accordingly put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution in the month of Auguſt, with the greateſt ſcorne that could be deuiſed, the two <hi>Nuncios</hi> or Legats hauing this inſcription vppon their Miters: <hi>Theſe men
<pb facs="tcp:14558:198"/>are diſloyall to the Church, and to the King.

               <p>Not to goe too farre from our owne times, the like cenſures came from Rome in time of our laſt troubles, in the yeere 1591. &amp; by the ſentence aſwel of the Court of Parliament of Paris, then remoued to Tours, as of the ſoueraine or high chamber, holden at Chalons in Champagnie, it was ordered, that the Bulls ſhould be burnt by the publique Executioner, as accordingly they were. A Maxime ſo grounded in the realme of France, that in the treatie of peace, which was made in the towne of Arras, in the yeere 1481, between king <hi>Lewes</hi> the 11, and <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Arch-duke of Auſtria, and the States of the Low-countries, the Deputies for <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imilian</hi> and the States, treated with ours, that the King ſhould promiſe to keepe &amp; obſerue this agreement, and to that end he and his ſonnes ſhould ſubmit themſelues to all Eccleſiaſticall cenſures: Notwithſtanding the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of the Kings of Fraunce, <hi>Whereby, neither hee nor his Realme, might bee compeld by Eccleſiasticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> Which treatie, was afterward confirmed by king <hi>Lewes</hi> the ſame yeere at Pleſſi, neere vnto Tours, the confirmation carrieth theſe words: <hi>Wee haue ſubmitted vs, and our ſaid ſonne, and our Realme, to all Eccleſiasticall cenſures, for the keeping and obſeruing of the ſaide treatie: notwithstanding the priuiledge which we haue, that wee, nor our ſucceſſours, nor our Realme, ought not to be ſubiect, nor liable to cenſures.</hi> VVhich thing hath beene ſince that time confirmed, by a decree made in the yeere 1549. <hi>Charles</hi> Cardinall of Lorraine, Archbiſhop of Reims, to make his memory immortall, by a moſt honourable action, founded an Vniuerſitie in Reims, with manie great priuiledges, hauing firſt obtained leaue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the King, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and next of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14558:198"/>Pope, <hi>Paule</hi> the third, for ſo much as concerned the ſpiritualties: who graunted forth his Buls verie large, and ample, contayning amongſt other clauſes, this one.</p>

Becauſe in the verification aſwell of the Buls, as of the kings Letters-patents, it was enacted by a decree in Court, giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the laſt ſaue one of Ianuary 1549, with this prouiſo, that notwithſtanding this pretended abſolution, it be not inferd, that the king hath beene, or hereafter may be, any way, or for any cauſe whatſoeuer, ſubiect to the excommunications, or cenſures Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, or thereby preiudice the rights, priuiledges, or preheminences of the king, and of his Realme.

                     </gap> Recer, ca. 32</note> I hope I ſhall not digreſſe from my purpoſe, if I entreat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Sect of the Ieſuits, which, to the ſubuerſion of our State, maintayneth principles quite contrarie to ours. The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits hauing got into their hands the great legacies, giuen and bequeathed them by Maiſter <hi>William du Part,</hi> Biſhop of Clairmont, they bought <hi>Langres</hi> place lying in Saint Iaques ſtreet in the Citie of Paris, where they, after their manner, eſtabliſhed the forme of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of a Monaſterie in diuers tenements: and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon them to inſtruct youth without the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Rector, they made ſute ſundrie times to be incorporated into the Vniuerſitie. Which when they
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14558:200"/>could not obtayne, they exhibited a petition to the ſame effect, to the Court of Parliament in the yeere 1564. The Vniuerſitie did me the honour, to chooſe me in a full congregation for their Aduocate. Hauing prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my ſelfe for the cauſe, (being armed with that ſacred Decree, which the facultie of Diuinity had pronounced againſt them in the yeere 1554. where thoſe two great pillers of our Catholique Religion, <hi>Monſieur Picard,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Maillard</hi> were aſſiſtants) I was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that I was able with a free and vncontrouled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to encounter hand to hand, with this monſter, which being neyther Secular, nor Regular, was both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and therefore brought into our Church an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, or mungrell profeſſion. We pleaded this caſe two whole forenoones, Maiſter <hi>Peter <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſoris,</hi> and I, he for the Ieſuits, I for the Vniuerſitie, before an infinite multitude of people, who attended, to ſee the iſſue thereof: Maiſter <hi>Baptist du Menill,</hi> the Kings Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, a man of great ſufficiencie, was for me. In my declaration, I alledged the irrigularitie of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; the iudgement, and determination of the whole facultie of Diuinitie, pronounced againſt them tenne yeeres before: the obiection made by <hi>Monſieur Bruſlard,</hi> the Kings Attorney Generall againſt their admittance, for that their vow was cleane contrarie to ours, that if we ſhould harbour them in our boſome, we ſhould bring in a Schiſme amongſt vs; and beſides, ſo many eſpials for Spayne, and ſworne enemies to Fraunce, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects whereof wee were like to feele, vpon the firſt chaunge that the iniquitie of time might bring vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding for the concluſion, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Counſell. Eyther partie both got, and loſt the day. For neither were they incorporated into the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity, nor yet prohibited to continue their accuſtomed readings. When God hath a purpoſe to afflict a realme,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:201"/>he planteth the roots thereof long time before hand, Theſe new-come gueſts, blind and bewitch the people by ſhewes of holines, and fayre promiſes. For, as if they had the gift of tongues, which the holy Ghoſt infuſed into the Apoſtles, they made their boaſts, that they (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) went to preach the Goſpel in the midſt of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſauage people, they that (God knowes) had ynough to do, to ſpeake their mother tongue. With theſe pleaſant baits did they inueigle and draw the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude into their ſnares. But as they had brought in a motly religion of Secular and Regular, diſturbing by meanes thereof all the Hierarchie of our Church, ſo did they intend, to trouble thence-forward, all the politique ſtates in Chriſtendome. In as much, as by a newe inuented rule, they beganne to mingle and confound the State with their religion. And as it is eaſie, to fall from liberty to vnbridled licence, ſo did they, vpon this irriguler rule of theirs, ground the moſt deteſtable hereſie, that can be deuiſed: affirming, that it is lawfull to murther any Prince, that ſhould not conforme himſelfe to their principles: treading vnder foot both the checke, which our Sauiour gaue to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when he drew his ſword in his defence, and the Canon of the Councell of Conſtance, whereby they were pronounced accurſt, that ſet abroach this poſition.</p>
               <p>When I pleaded the cauſe, I mentioned not theſe two propoſitions againſt them. For though they bred them in their hearts, yet had they not as yet hatched them: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſaid, that there was no good to be hoped for of this monſter: but that they would euer put in practiſe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that principle, which was broched by the old Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer, who in time of our wars beyond the Seas, diſperſed his ſubiects, called cut-throats, or murtherers, through the the Prouinces, to ſlay the Chriſtian Princes: or that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Anabaptiſme, which ſprung vp in Germanie, when we were young: this ſhould I neuer haue imagined.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14558:201"/>Notwithſtanding, both the one and the other Maxime, hath beene by them put in execution, in the ſight and knowledge of all Chriſtendome. For as concerning the firſt, there is no man but knowes, that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hauing ſet foot in Portugall, not vnder the title of Ieſuits; but of Apoſtles, they ſollicited King <hi>Sebastian</hi> by all maner of illuſions, to make an vniuerſall law, that none might be called to the Crowne, vnleſſe he were of their Societie: and moreouer, elected by the conſent, &amp; ſuffrages of the ſame. VVhereunto they could not attayne, albeit they met with the moſt deuout and ſuperſtitious Prince that could be. And not to lead you out of our owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Fraunce; they were the men, that kindled the firſt coales of that accurſed League, which hath beene the vtter ruine and ſubuerſion of the land. It was firſt of all debated amongſt them, and being concluded, they conſtituted their Fathers, <hi>Claudius Matthaeus</hi> a Lorrain, and <hi>Claudius Sammier</hi> of Luxembourg, (for ſo are their Prieſts of greateſt antiquitie called) to be their trumpets for the proclayming thereof ouer all forraine nations. And after that time, did they with open face, declare themſelues to be Spaniards, as well in their Sermons, as publique Lectures. In fauour of whom, they attempted to bring their ſecond principle into practiſe, not all the while that the King was diuided from vs in religion (for they knew, that was a barre ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keepe him from the Crowne) but as ſoone as they ſaw him reclaymed into the boſome of the Church, they ſet on worke one <hi>Peter Barriere,</hi> a man reſolute for execution, but weake and tender in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: whom they cauſed to be confeſſed in their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at Paris, afterwards to receiue the Sacrament, and hauing confirmed him by an aſſured promiſe of Paradiſe, as a true Martyr, if he died in that quarrell, ſet forward this valiant Champion, who was thriſe at the the verie point to execute his accurſed enterpriſe; and
<pb facs="tcp:14558:202"/>God as often miraculouſly ſtayed his hand, vntill at length being apprehended at Melun, he receiued the iuſt hyre of his trayterous intention, in the yeere, 1593.</p>
               <p>I ſpeake nothing, but what mine eyes can witneſſe, and what I had from his owne mouth when he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. View, &amp; peruſe all the impieties, that you will, you ſhall find none ſo barbarous as this. To perſwade an impietie, and then to couer it with ſuch a ſeeming maske of pietie: In a word, to deſtroy a ſoule, a King, Paradiſe, and our Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all at a blow, to make way for their Spaniſh and halfe-Pagan deſignements. All theſe new allegations, cauſed the Vniuerſitie of Paris, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being brought vnder the Kings obedience, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their former ſuit againſt them, which had beene ſtayed before time by the Counſels appoyntment. The cauſe was pleaded effectually and learnedly, by Maiſter <hi>Authonie Arnald:</hi> but when the proceſſe was brought to the verie poynt of Iudgement, there fell out another accident, which made them proceed roundly thereunto. <hi>Iohn Chastell,</hi> a Paritian of the age of 19. yeeres, a graft of this accurſed Seminarie, ſtroke our king <hi>Henris</hi> the fourth with a knife in his Royall Pallace of the Louvre, in the midſt of his Nobilitie.

               <p>VVee are (ſaith the hypocriticall Ieſuit in his moſt humble petition preſented to the King) enemies to Kings, the ſtate, and your perſon, &amp; ſeducers of youth. Againſt theſe generall accuſations, we firſt oppoſe the
<pb facs="tcp:14558:206"/>teſtimonie of the Court of Parliament of Paris. The Court had heard the Aduocates, which brought, and emptied their baggs, loden with theſe weightie accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it had beene with all importunitie ſollicited to condemne vs: It had aboue 9. months reſpite to weigh and ballance the cauſe; that is, from the laſt of Aprill, vntill Chriſtmas following: It condemned vs not, but ſuffered vs to remaine in peaceable poſſeſſion of our rights, reſeruing it ſelfe to a fitter ſeaſon, to call them to account, which had moſt vncharitably ſuggeſted theſe calumnious accuſations againſt vs.</p>
               <p>Thinke you, that this body of Iuſtice, compoſed of the moſt famous ornaments of the Lawe, vvhich the world yeelds, and of the ſtrongeſt &amp; firmeſt members of the ſtate, if it had ſeene the leaſt of theſe crimes, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prooued, as they were maliciouſly obiected, thinke you, I ſay, that it would not haue proceeded, to condemne vs in the very inſtant? And hauing not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned vs, hath it not, by his ſilence, condemned our Accuſers, and giuen moſt aſſured teſtimonie of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie? If ſince that time it haue condemned vs, that proceeded not of the due and formall pleadings of the Aduocates, or of any aduantage of law, which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries had againſt vs: it is an inconuenience vvhich hath condemned vs in coſts, but not ouer-throwne our cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And vvithin a fewe leaues after:</hi> In Iuly 1594, at what time the proceſſe was reuiued by two pleading Aduocates, they charged vs with <hi>Barriere,</hi> and framed many like imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to agranate this crime againſt our credite and reputation. But all theſe were but blunt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, not ſharpe proofes, proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tongue, and not from the truth, the Court made no reckoning of them, and by their ſilence cleered &amp; acquited vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rene de la Fon</hi> followeth his ſteppes, and goeth about to proue in like manner, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning of <hi>Chastell,</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:14558:206"/>is the acquiting of all their Societie: in as much as hee being racked and tortured, appeached none of them. But theyr intelligence was very bad in this matter: For albeit this wretched fellow by his aunſwers, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories to him miniſtred, ſpared the names of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers, yet did he accuſe the whole Order in generall, as I wil verifie hereafter more at large. Moreouer, theſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits ſeeme to be both of them, altogether ignorant in the courſe of Iudgements, pronounced by thoſe high Courts.</p>
               <p>The Court (ſaith the firſt) hath not forthwith procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this cauſe, notwithſtanding the ſharp accuſations wherewith we were charged: <hi>Ergo,</hi> by his ſilence it pronounced vs guiltleſſe. Furthermore, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere</hi> his fact was laid to our charge, yet the Court would not preſently condemne vs; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Court intended by ſilence to acquite vs thereof. I beſeech you, ſeeing you profeſſe your ſelues to be Logicians, &amp; to haue the ſtart of all men in ſcholaſticall Diuinitie, by what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples can you make good theſe concluſions?

               <p>High and ſoueraigne Courts, obſerue another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding. They heare the Counſell on both parties, yet reſt not thereupon: but in ſuch important cauſes as this eſpecially, they remit their iudgement or ſentence, to their better leyſure, and to theyr ſecond thoughts. The like courſe was held in their cauſe. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi> and <hi>Dole,</hi> vrged in their Declarations, the tragical hiſtorie of <hi>Barriere,</hi> the Court gaue no credite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, and not without good conſideration. In as much as it was requiſite for them to view <hi>Barriere</hi> his triall or proceſſe, which was made at Melun by <hi>Lugoly,</hi> that they
<pb facs="tcp:14558:207"/>might be throughly informed of what had there paſſed. But alas Ieſuit, what is become of thy wit? Thou dooſt acknowledge this Court to conſiſt of the greateſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law, which the world yeeldeth: as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where alſo, that referring both parties to counſell, they had proceeded without paſſion, or partialitie: and yet in the inſtant, thou changeſt thy note, challenging it to haue done iniuſtice, in grounding their ſentence againſt you vpon <hi>Chastell,</hi> who had not accuſed you. Iudges proceede indirectly, when eyther they want skill to iudge, or that their iudgements are corrupted by hatred, fauour, or other ſuch partial affections. Neither of theſe defects can be ſhewed in the managing of your cauſe, as your ſelfe confeſſe: therefore it is preſumption in vs both: in you to aſſay by Sophiſtrie, out of your ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe braine to elude this ſentence: in mee, to endeuour by reaſons and arguments, to maintaine and vphold the fame.</p>
               <p>Let it ſuffice vs, that it is a Decree, or Arreſt, and it is our part therefore to reſt our iudgements there-vppon. In all cauſes, eſpecially in thoſe of weight, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, like this, GOD is in the midſt of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to inſpire and direct them. Many times a man, that hauing heard a caſe pleaded on both ſides, prepared himſelfe in his minde, either to acquite; or condemne, this or that partie, yet, when hee heares the firſt Iudge deliuer his opinion, hee changeth his mind: yea, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falleth out, that one word vttered by the firſt, giueth new light to him that ſecondeth, when as happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that ſpake it, dreamt not thereon: and when it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the caſting of the Bell, (for by that by-word doe the Lavvyers terme the vp-ſhot, or concluſion of all) they gather and collect out of the precedent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a generall ayre, or abſtract, whereuppon this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is built.</p>
               <p>Dooſt thou think, that <hi>Chastells</hi> fact was the ſole oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14558:207"/>of your fall? thou art deceiued. The Court had wiſely referred the cauſe to counſell, giuiuing thereby to vnderſtand, that it meant not to proceed therein ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with paſſion, or raſh haſtines, two great enemies of iuſtice. In the meane time hapned this damnable act, committed by one of your ſchollers: the principals which were before diſpoſed to your condemning, were taken in hand a freſh: in the handling of <hi>Chastels</hi> cauſe, your cauſe is adiudged all vnder one.</p>
               <p>The indignitie and deteſtation therof, awaked iuſtice in the hearts of the Iudges, which in your cauſe might peraduenture haue ſlept, had it not beene thereby ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and excited. And in all this, there is nothing wrought by man, but by a ſpeciall iudgement of God, which wee ought to proclayme through the whole world. It is well knowne, that your Colledge was the fountayne, and ſeminarie of all thoſe calamities, which we endured, during the laſt troubles. There was the rebellion plotted and contriued, there was it fully and wholly nouriſhed and maintayned; your Prouincials, your Rectors, your deuout Superiours, were the firſt that troad that path, they that firſt and laſt dealt with this merchandiſe. Your Colledge was the retreat, or <hi>Randeuous,</hi> of all ſuch as had vowed, and ſold themſelues aſwell to the deſtruction of the State, as to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King: in which your doings, you at that time gloried, and triumpht, both in your Sermons and Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>The true hearted ſubiects, who had the <hi>Flower de Luce</hi> imprinted in their breaſts, beheld this tyranny, and ſighed in their ſoules, for they durſt not giue breath to their ſighes; all their recourſe was to God, that it would pleaſe him to haue compaſſion on their miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. God ſuffered you to raigne fiue yeeres and more, (ſwaying both people, Magiſtrate, and Prince) to trie whether there were any hope of your amendment in
<pb facs="tcp:14558:208"/>time. The King was no ſooner entred into Paris, but the iuſt hatred of the people towards you, brake forth: the Vniuerſitie of Paris ſtirreth againſt you, and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth their former ſuite, which had beene referred to Counſell in the yeere 1564. the occaſion thereof was founded vpon your owne freſh practiſes, and lewd miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours: the cauſe is pleaded by two worthie Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, <hi>Arnauld</hi> and <hi>Dole,</hi> heard with patience diſcreetly, not iudged forthwith, by reaſon of the waightines: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the heat and choler of thoſe which proſecuted the cauſe againſt them, might in time coole, and aſſwage (as the manner of French men is.) The Iudges neuer ſtirre in any cauſe, but as they are vrged thereunto; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they ſhould doe themſelues wrong, and men might ſay, they were rather ſoliciters, then Iudges. In this pauſe, the iudgement of your cauſe was likely to haue beene forgotten, when on a ſodain, beyond all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, this fact of <hi>Chastels</hi> came to paſte, whereby the humors both of the Iudges, and of the parties are ſtirred a freſh.</p>
               <p>This was the houre of Gods wrath, who hauing long temporized with your ſinnes, thought it good to make <hi>Chastell</hi> a ſpurre in the hearts of the Iudges, to incite them, to doe iuſtice aſwell vpon you, as vpon him, and that you might all ſerue for an example, for poſteritie to wonder at. To the accompliſhing of this worke, he permitted that <hi>Chastell</hi> (who had beene nurtured, and brought vp in your ſchoole) ſhould aſſay to put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe your deuout Lectures, and exhortations againſt the King, not in the countrie, but in the Citie of Paris, and that his dwelling ſhould be, not in any obſcure corner of the Town, but in the verie hart of the City, ſtanding as it were in the midſt of two other Townes, &amp; moreouer, in a houſe right oppoſit to the gate of the Palace, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent habitation of our Kings, &amp; of the ſupreme and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Iuſtice of Fraunce. This houſe belonged to the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14558:208"/>father, who was ſo infortunate, as not to reueale to the Magiſtrate the damnable intention of his ſonne, wherof he had knowledge, as himſelfe confeſſed. God made ſpeciall choiſe of that place, of purpoſe to make the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment more notorious. For in like offences of high Treaſon, the Iudges are in dutie bound to their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, to cauſe the habitations of the malefactors to be raced, and pulled downe, and there to be engrauen a memoriall of the whole proceeding: for which cauſe this houſe was ruinated, &amp; raced by order, &amp; in the place thereof a Pyramis or piller raiſed, bearing the memoriall, not onely of <hi>Chastells</hi> offence, but of the Ieſuits alſo, and this to ſtand in oppoſite view of this great and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Pallace. To the end, that our poſteritie may know hereafter, how highly Fraunce is beholding to this holy Societie of Ieſus. Was there euer, I ſay not in Fraunce, but in the whole world, a more famous or notorious puniſhment, then this?</p>

Doſt thou in a brauerie ſay more, then that offender durſt ſay, being vrged therunto with ſuch rigorous tortures? Aſſuredly, the force of a ſtrong fancie or imagination is great, and wonderfull: not only to cauſe theſe prodigious effects in our minds, but euen in our bodies themſelues. For ſo we read, that <hi>Craeſus</hi> his ſonne beeing dumbe, recouered ſpeech, ſeeing his father in daunger to be ſlaine: and <hi>Cippus</hi> a King of Italy, ſitting to behold the fight of the Buls, with a fixt and ſtedfaſt apprehenſion, fell a ſleepe, and when he awaked, he felt his forehead planted with a paire of hornes.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Lucius Coſſitius,</hi> greedily and furiouſly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the pleaſure, which he expected of his wife that ſhould be, the firſt night of his mariage, was chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a woman.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14558:209"/>I thinke it beſt that thou ſhouldeſt be aunſwered by a ſtone, but a moſt auncient, and authentique ſtone, the great and venerable <hi>Paſquils</hi> of Rome, who ſuiteth and reſembleth you in many poynts. For as you iudge Kings and Princes by certayne texts of Scripture, wreſted and miſunderſtood, ſo hath <hi>Paſquill</hi> beene allowed from all memorie, to do the like by Popes and Cardinals, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame texts, ordered after his owne liking, and appetite.

               <p>Conſidering which ſympathie &amp; argreement betwixt you &amp; him, I make no doubt but you will be the rather inclined to beleeue him.

               <p>Seeing therefore your intent was to commence ſuite againſt a ſtone, I preſumed that the hearing of the cauſe, belonged abſolutely to my ſelfe, and to none other. And that you may vnderderſtand, with what diligence and iuſtice I haue proceeded in the examination thereof, I remembred that your cauſe had been twiſe pleaded, and twiſe referred to counſell: Firſt, in the yeere 1564. wherein you were plantiues, ſuing to bee incorporated into the Vniuerſitie of Paris: Secondly, in the yeere 1594. wherein the Vniuerſitie of Paris were plantiues, requiring that you might be inſtantly baniſhed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the land. To be throughly informed of the firſt, I required a Copie of <hi>Paſquier</hi> his declaration againſt you, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſoris</hi> his Plea for you, as alſo of the latter, by <hi>Meſmll,</hi> the Kings Aduocate. By all which I found, that the onely matter in queſtion at that time, was the nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſtraunge rule of your Order, being contrarie to the auncient liberties of the Church of Fraunce. And being deſirous to be yet further inſtructed in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, behold certaine mutinous ſpirits, preſent me with three bookes on your behalfe: In the firſt, were contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Buls by you obtayned for your commoditie and aduantage: In the ſecond, were your orders or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, diuided into tenne parts: In the third, the Examen, or, if I may ſo terme it, the Abſtract, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement thereof. Out of which, I collected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poynts, which before time were to me altogether vnknowne: a ſimple and abſolute vow, which your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies alleage to be full of ſubteltie, and hereſie; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extraordinarie vſurpations vppon the Ordinaries, and Vniuerſities: a rich kind of pouertie profeſſed by
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14558:210"/>vow: a blinded obedience to your Sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ion: (for as for that to the Pope, I meddle not ther withal.) your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Buls, wherein it ſeemes you haue ſurpriſed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the ſanctitie of the holy Sea. Whereupon I ſaid, that, that villaine, whatſoeuer he was, that brought theſe bookes out of your Colledges, deſerued to be hanged for his paynes.</p>
               <p>It is not meet the world ſhould know the ſecrets of a profeſt Societie: It doth but open mens mouthes to ſcanne, and deſcant thereupon at their pleaſures, to the diſcredit and diſgrace of the whole Order. But ſeeing the offender cannot be diſcouered, I thinke it beſt, that theſe three bookes be ſent backe into one of your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, there to receiue open diſcipline for this offence. This is not the firſt time, that ſenceleſſe things haue beene dealt withall. For in that manner doe we read, that the Sea hauing treſpaſſed againſt <hi>Zerxes,</hi> that wiſe and prudent king of Perſia, who had purpoſed to paſſe ouer into Greece vpon a bridge of cordes, was by him condemned to be whipt. As contrariwiſe, the Signio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Venice, to flatter and infinuate with the Sea, is wont yeerely vpon Aſcenſion day, to eſpouſe and wed it with a Ring, which they preſent vnto it. I aſſure you, when I compared the priuiledges of the Church of Fraunce, with yours, I ſtood greatly perplexed, what to thinke: holding this with my ſelfe for a law inuiolable, that houſoeuer all lawes were wauering and vncertaine, according to the chaunge and alteration of times, yet this ſtood firme, ſtedfaſt, and immutable, that we are to liue according to the lawes of that countrey, wherein we defire to liue. And finding your Buls and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to goe ſlat againſt the liberties of the Church of Fraunce, it bred no ſmall ſcruple in my mind, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I was inclined or deuoted to fauour your cauſe.</p>
               <p>Hauing viewed and reuiewed, the bookes and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, concerning the firſt cauſe, which was referred to
<pb facs="tcp:14558:211"/>counſel: I paſſed ouer to the ſecond inſtance, of the yere 1594. wherin I employed all the powers of my braine. Herein you were not called in queſtion for your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or profeſſion any more, but for your attempts, and practiſes, made aſwell againſt Princes and Princeſſes, as againſt the ſeuerall countries, wherein you are reſident, and eſpecially againſt the Realme of Eraunce. A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter full of waight, difficultie, and of daungerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: which cauſed me, for the diſcharge of my place and conſcience, to interpoſe my ſelfe in this cauſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that cuſtome which I haue hitherto learned and practiſed. For in other caſes, I receiue ſuch pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, as my Vaſſels and Subiects liſt to impart, giuing credit thereunto vpon their bare relations. But in this, I haue taken a farre other courſe. For hauing peruſed your petitionarie booke, full of pittie and compaſſion, I ſent forth ſummons to all quarters without exception, to come in, and ſpeake their knowledge in the matter: I directed out Commiſſions ouer all countries (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prerogatiue, which from all antiquitie hath beene graunted me through the whole ſtate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome) to informe me aſwell by letters, as by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, of what I thought requiſite for your iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, commaunding all Iudges, of what qualitie foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, (vpon payne of a grieuous fine at my pleaſure) to ſend me the whole proceſſe, aſwell criminall, as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, which had paſſed in your cauſe; being reſolued, your innocence once verified, and confirmed, to caſt downe this Pyramis, and to preferre this ſentence into the Inquiſition. As your ſelues ſometimes cauſed the cenſure and determination of the Sorbone, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt you in the yeere 1554. to be cenſured by the Inquiſition of Spayne. For it is not for euerie man to iuſtle with your holy Fatherhoods.</p>
               <p>And that which pronoked mee the rather hereunto, was your booke, wherein reading, to my great diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14558:211"/>the hard meaſure which hath beene ſhewen you, by the Court of Parliament of Paris, yet you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſaid Court, to excell all other in knowledge, iuſtice, and religion. Vpon my ſummons (I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the truth) there appeared at the firſt daſh a great troope of French, Engliſh, Scottiſh, Arragonians, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugalls, Polanders, Flemings, Swethlanders, who repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much more then I deſired to heare. And albeit the peoples voyce be the voyce of God, (if you belieue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prouerbe) yet would not I for the ſequell build my iudgment thereon.</p>
               <p>Your owne booke, increaſed my ſcruple &amp; doubt, much more then before, when for your iuſtification you ſay, that in the yeere 1593. by a generall Synode, holden by your Societie at Rome, thoſe of your Order were forbidden to entermeddle henceforward in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State: which poynt I could not well conceiue. They are prohibited (ſaid I) to entermeddle hence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in State matters, therefore it is preſuppoſed, that heretofore they haue medled therein. I cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that theſe deuout and holie men, did euer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelues that way: becauſe ſuch is the calamitie of our times, that in our State affaires, wee harbour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more impietie then Religion, to bring our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignements to paſſe. And ſtanding thus in ſuſpence, one rounded me in the eare, and bad mee be cleere of that poynt: for he that made <hi>The Defence of the Colledge of Clairmont,</hi> in 1594, hath inſerted (ſaith he) the whole article in Latine. I called for the booke, &amp; found it true, as he told me.</p>
               <p>Another brought me <hi>Montaignes</hi> his booke: reade this place (ſaith he) heere you ſhall find the foundation and originall of our laſt troubles. In this booke I finde, that Father <hi>Claudius Mathew,</hi> and <hi>Aimond Auger,</hi> were ſometimes in high fauour with <hi>Henry</hi> the third: in ſo much, as oftentimes hee tooke them into his Coach:
<pb facs="tcp:14558:212"/>after hee addeth; That ſathan hauing caſt into the Realme the Apple of ſtrife, ſuſpition, and ielouſie, all things changed their courſe, and then was brewed that vineger and gall of ciuile diſſentions, which ſince that time wee haue ſeene and taſted. As to all texts, there want no comments: ſo in the reading of this place, thys fellow ſaid vnto me, that two words ſufficed to a good vnderſtander, and that this alteration fell out by meanes of the repulſe, which theſe two bleſſed Fathers receiued of the King, when he ſaw them begin to ſet their hands to matters of State: and that they played as did <hi>Narſes</hi> the Eunuch, whom the Empreſſe commaunding to goe and ſpin her diſtaffe: he made aunſwere, that he would ſpin her ſuch a quill, as ſhee, or her husband ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to vnwind. And indeed kept promiſe with her, by bringing the Lombards into Italie.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, theſe two honeſt Ieſuits, beeing eſtranged from the grace and fauour of the King, would let him know, they could skill of ſomwhat elſe, then to ſay ouer our Ladies Pſalter. And to ſpeake freely what I think, I neuer knew mon of a better conſcience, then are thoſe of your Societie, nor that leſſe feared to incur the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Rome. Firſt Father <hi>Henrie Sammiere,</hi> (a ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pragmaticall fellow) confeſſed, that about the yeere 1580, or 81, (if I miſtake not) he was ſent by you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers Countries, to treate or commune about the generall reuolt, which you intended to ſtirre vp againſt the late King of Fraunce. And albeit I maintained, that it was neyther true nor probable, in as much as you had no cauſe at that time to attempt it; he bad me, ſeeing I beleeued not his words, to looke but vpon the arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and triall of <hi>William Parry</hi> an Engliſhman, vvho was executed the third of March, 1584. that there I ſhould finde at the latter end of a certaine Letter, which he wrote to the Queene during his impriſonment, <hi>That ſhee ſhould finde, the King of Fraunce had enough to doe as
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14558:212"/>home, when ſhee neede of his helpe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parry</hi> (as <hi>Sammiere</hi> told me) departed out of England in 1582, and came into Fraunce, where hee was dealt withall by our Societie to deſtroy the Queene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and to make an innouation in the State, and when he obiected, that it would hardly be brought to paſſe, in as much as ſhe were like to be ayded, and aſſiſted by the King of Fraunce, we made him aunſwer, that we would cut out the King of Fraunce ſo much worke, that his hands ſhould be full of his owne buſines, without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ayde or ſuccour another. Whereby it appeares, that euen in thoſe daies our web was on the loome.</p>
               <p>I had not at that time the acts of <hi>Parry</hi> his tryall, but hauing ſince procured them, I haue read the Letter, &amp; haue found all true that <hi>Sammiere</hi> reported. Who in a good meaning proceeded further, and confeſſed, that himſelfe, and <hi>Roſcieux,</hi> were ſent in 1584. to the King of Spaine, and Father <hi>Claudius Mathew,</hi> to Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the 13. to vnderſtand, what ſummes of mony they were willing to contribute, towards the charges &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of the holy League: whereunto <hi>Roſcieux</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; Yea, but this honeſt Munk telleth you not, what a caſt of his office he ſhewed me. For hee and I riding poſt together, he, perceiuing one night, that I, beeing wearied with trauaile, was buried in a dead ſleepe, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed freſh poaſt-horſe to be brought him, and away hee went, leauing me in bed for a pawne: and ſuch ſpeede and diligence he vſed, as that our whole buſines was by him, almoſt diſpatched with the King of Spayne, before I could ouertake him.</p>
               <p>To bring this proceſſe to a concluſion, <hi>I</hi> cauſed to be brought vnto me the pleadings of <hi>Arnauld,</hi> Aduocate for the Vniuerſitie, and <hi>Dole,</hi> who was retaind for the Curats of Paris. The aunſwere to the ſame, vnder the name of the Colledge of Clairmont: <hi>Frauncis de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taignes</hi> his booke <hi>De la veritè Defendue,</hi> againſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:213"/>and certaine other bookes, or euidences, ſeruing to the ſtate of the cauſe. I belieued <hi>Sammier</hi> for ſo much as concerned himſelfe: but as for Father <hi>Claudius Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> I would not the memorie of him ſhould be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vpon another mans confeſſion. Wherefore I had recourſe to the litterall proofe, and read <hi>Arnauldus</hi> his pleadings, wherein he toucheth him to the quick: and the aunſwere thereunto, contained in that Plea, which is as followeth; <hi>And whereas</hi> Arnauldus <hi>alledgeth, that</hi> Claudius Matthew, <hi>of the Order of the ſaid Defendants, hath beene the Authour, and contriuer of the League: the ſaid Defendants aunſwere, that</hi> Claudius Matthew, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſpent his whole time in their Colledges, &amp; amongst chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, liuing euer in the courſe of a Scholler, could not haue iudgement, policie, industrie, and authoritie requiſite, for the contriuing and knitting, of ſo great &amp; strong a League. And be it, that the ſaide Mathew, endeuoured to fortifie the ſayd League, as many others of all estates &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions haue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doone, that prooues not therefore that he was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, or beginner thereof. Beſides, this is but one particular.</hi> And fiue or ſixe lines after, <hi>There was not one of them at the first acquanted with his actions, and had they beene, yet could they not haue hindered them, inaſmuch as hee vvas their Superiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Comparing <hi>Arnaulds</hi> obiection with this colde and faint ſolution, mee thought you were agreed, that Fraunce ſhould thinke her ſelfe beholding to none but your ſelues for her laſt troubles. And deſiring more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to informe my conſcience, as touching the Reuolt, which happened in Paris, euen in the Sorbon it ſelfe, the ſeauenth of Ianuarie, 1589, there came a crew of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, beeing men of credit and reputation, who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified me, that in truth, they were at that time aſſembled to debate the matter, &amp; that all the auncienter ſort, were of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie opinion, howſoeuer the younger were not, the greater part whereof, had beene ſchollers to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14558:213"/>of Paris. So as the voyces being numbred, and not weighed, it was carried away by pluralitie. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they did not as yet altogether looſe the reynes to rebellion, but determined to ſuſpend the effect of thys their concluſion, vntill ſuch time as it were confirmed and ratified by the Sea Apoſtolick. But the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Father <hi>Iames Commolet,</hi> a Ieſuit, ſounded the drum within Paris. And that I might be aſſured, if not of the whole, yet of the greateſt part of the premiſſes, by the annuall Letters of the Ieſuits, of the yeere 1589, and moreouer, by their Pleas, I went directly to theyr Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and found in thoſe, which were written from your Colledge of Paris, <hi>Doctores Sorbonici, quorum magna pars diſcipuli nostri fuere:</hi> The Doctours of the Sorbone, a great part whereof haue beene our Schollers. And by your Pleas: <hi>It is certaine that for thoſe fewe yeeres, a great part of the Bachelers of Diuinitie, &amp; the better ſort of them, haue ſpent the courſe of their ſtudies in our Colledge.</hi> Which cauſed mee ſomewhat to ſuſpect, that thys concluſion, had been before handled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time in your Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>I read in the ſame Letter, that notwithſtanding you were inhibited by <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 13. to come at any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, yet as ſoone as the Reuolt was concluded on, one of your Societie, to ſtirre the people againſt theyr King, aſſembled three or foure thouſand boyes, which he led in proceſſion all ouer the cittie, with a rabble of all ſorts of people at their heeles. I read in another place, that about that verie time, you inſtituted in Lyons, the Brotherhood of our Lady, and in Burges, of the Paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, vnder the name of Ieronomitans, not to appeaſe the wrath of GOD, but to prouoke it againſt the late King.</p>
               <p>And as I was turning ouer your Letters, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in Father <hi>Iames Commolet,</hi> (whom I name with al due title of honor) who with teares ſtanding in his eyes,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:214"/>(as one that at al times hath teares at commaundement) confeſſed vnto me, that the day following this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sorbone, hee in a Sermon made at the Church of Saint <hi>Meri,</hi> publiquely preached, that the whole Sorbone, was reſolued to take Armes againſt the King, &amp; if any ſhould oppoſe themſelues, to withſtand it, they ought not to thinke it ſtrange, in aſmuch as in that number which followed our Sauiour, (the moſt perfit ſocietie that euer was) there was one <hi>Iudas</hi> found. And that thereuppon, the people ranne head-long to Armes. Wherein hee ingeniouſly confeſſed his fault, in concealing from the people, that this Reſolution, vvas referred to the pleaſure and arbitrement of the holie Sea.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that the 15. of the ſame Month, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the chiefe and principall Iudges of the Court of Parliament, beeing committed pryſoners to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtille, he went to viſite and comfort them: and for theyr conſolation, preached nothing elſe but of the tyrannie of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the third; thereby to ſtirre and excite them to rebelliou: &amp; that he who had been their king, ſhould be ſo no longer.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, that as long as the Troubles endured, hee was a Trumpet in all Churches, to rend and deface the reputation, as well of the late King, as of him that nowe raigneth: but that this was vſuall with all Preachers, and therefore the more excuſable in him. Which <hi>Montaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> did not denie, excuſing it by the heate and choller vvhich is incident to Preachers when they are in the Pulpit.</p>
               <p>With that, a troubleſome fellow whiſpering mee in the care, bad me, looke to my ſelfe: For (ſaith he) that which he termes choler, he would ſay it were the holie Spirit, if he durſt. I told him, hee was a buſie compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bad him hold his tongue, if hee could. All thys did <hi>Commolet</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe he had done in Paris: but Father
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:14558:214"/>
                  <hi>Bernard Ronillet</hi> proceeded on further, &amp; acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that by his packing and preaching, hee had vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne the cittie of Bourges, from the obedience of the King. But aboue all, the Confeſſion of Father <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hayes</hi> did moſt ſatisfie me, who entertained me with theſe words.</p>
               <p>Right honourable <hi>Paſquill,</hi> ſeeing you charge and coniure me in the name of God, and in vertue of the Apoſtolicall cenſures, I will deliuer my whole knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as well concerning the proceedings of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at Paris, as mine owne particuler actions in thys buſines. As touching the generall; I muſt confeſſe to you, that vppon the firſt breaking out of the Troubles, wee preſently inſtituted within our Colledge of Paris a Brotherhoode, which we named a Congregation in the honour of our Lady, beeing for that cauſe, called the Congregation of the Chappelet, becauſe the Brethren of that Companie, were bound to carry a Chappelet, or payre of Beades, and to ſay it ouer once a day. Into this Congregation, did all the zealous and deuout perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our holy League, cauſe themſelues to be enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Lord <hi>Mendoza,</hi> Embaſſadour for the Catholick King of Spayne, the Sixteene Gouernours of Paris, with their whole families, and diuers other holy &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, whereof I haue kept no regiſter, neither was it any part of my charge.</p>
               <p>Our Congregation was kept euery Sonday in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine high Chappell, where all the brotherhood vvas bound to be preſent, if there were no neceſſarie cauſe of let or impediment. There were we all ſeuerally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed on the Saturdayes, and on Sonday wee receiued the Sacrament. When Maſſe was done, one of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers went into the Pulpet, and there exhorted all the Audience to continue ſtedfaſt in their holy deuotion, which at this day is in Fraunce called Rebellion, (ſith it pleaſeth the Magiſtrats to haue it ſo, I cannot be againſt
<pb facs="tcp:14558:215"/>it). This done, all the common ſort departed, and thoſe of greateſt place and authoritie ſtayed behind, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about the affayres of the holy League. Our good Father, <hi>Odon Pigenat,</hi> vvas long time Preſident of that Counſell. And this briefely in the ſumme of what I am able to deliuer, as touching the generall proceedings of the whole Colledge.</p>
               <p>As concering my ſelfe in particular, you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thoſe that know mee, call me Father <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Hayes</hi> the Scot, who, during the troubles, was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the firſt Forme of our Colledge, for the ſpace of 3. or 4. yeeres. Not to recapitulate the whole, but ſome of the principall, and moſt notable acts of my hiſtorie, which may peraduenture giue light to the reſidue: I read to mine Auditours, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his Inuectiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Phillip</hi> king of Macedonia, where in I ſome-what ſuited with our good Father <hi>Commolet:</hi> for as hee wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to his purpoſe, all the texts of Scripture againſt the<note place="margin">n="*" A by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, which the leaguers gaue the king that now is, for that he was borne in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arne.</note> 
                  <hi>Biarnois,</hi> (giue me leaue to vſe that terme before your Highnes, which was then currant in Paris,) ſo did I play by the <hi>Philippica,</hi> which to ſay truth, were not Lectures, but deſpightful railings againſt him, which I amplified accordingly, as I was caried by a violent kind of deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I was neuer able to bridle or reſtraine. For it was an ordinary braunch of my Lectures, that he were a happy man whoſoeuer could kill him; &amp; if he fortuned to die in the execution of ſo bleſſed an enterpriſe, hee ſhould goe directly into Paradiſe, and though his ſoule were ſtained with ſome veniall ſinnes, yet ſhould it be exempted from the paines of Purgatory. And if God ſhould ſo much afflict the citie of Paris, as that the <hi>Biar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> ſhould enter, &amp; paſſe through S. <hi>Iames</hi> his gate, I made open proteſtation, that I would leape downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the higheſt window in our Colledge: being aſſuredly perſwaded, that this fall, would ſerue me for a ladder, to clime vp into heauen.</p>

               <p>That day, that hee firſt heard Maſſe at Saint <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> vnderſtanding that certaine of my Auditors had beene preſent thereat, I debarred them the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my Lecture, as perſons excommunicated, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them to enter, vntill they were abſolued for it by ſome of our Societie. When men began to muner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a peace, I commaunded one of my Auditors, the beſt ſcholler among them, to declaime in Greeke, touching the miſeries of Fraunce, and the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gulph of calamities to enſue, whereinto ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout deſperately to plunge her ſellfe: (this was, as I ſaid, the time of the conference, when euerie man on both parties breathed nothing, but vnitie, and reconcilement) the ſcholler, forgetting thoſe particulers, which I had preſcribed him, onely propounding to himſelfe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſubiect of the miſeries of Fraunce, declaimed and diſcourſed firſt of the miſeries and calamities, which happen in a Realme, by the rebellion and diſobedience of the ſubiects: which, he ſaid, to be the gulph, wheinto God ſuffered a nation to fall, when after his long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, he would haue them feele his hand, for ſome tranſgreſſions, which he had long time ſuffered to go vnpuniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Aterwards he declared, that the miſgouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a Prince, could not exempt the ſubiects from their alleageance: which he likewiſe confirmed by an infinite number of examples, ſhewing what ill ſucceſſe they euer had, who were of a contrarie minde. I ſeeing him forſake the path, that I had preſcribed, and take a farre different courſe, grew mightily out of patience, and made him come downe out of the ſeat; calling him caytife, and heretique, with many other reprochfull termes. The firſt day that the Reading began, after the Citie of Paris was reduced to the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the <hi>Biar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> one of my ſchollers, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into the colledge before the houre, wrote all about my Forme, <hi>God ſaue the King.</hi> When I came in, and eſpied this ſhamefull act, my cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb facs="tcp:14558:216"/>turned into rage, and with a fell and terrible voyce, I exclaymed, <hi>Quis ita infecit parietes nostros?</hi> Who is it, that hath thus berayed our walles? If I knew what he were that hath made theſe ſcribble-ſcrabbles, (for that was my terme) I would cauſe the Preſident of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to puniſh him openly: and after dinner, I made it to be wiped out, adding withall, that if I might know any man hereafter, that ſhould beſcribble the walles in that order, I would make him feele, how much I was diſpleaſed withall. I confeſſe freely, (right honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Paſquill</hi>) what I haue done, neither doe I feare to ſpeake it, ſeeing I am now in the Citie of Rome, and none of the <hi>Biarnois</hi> his Subiects, being a Scot by birth, and be it that I were a natural Frenchman, yet am I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that all theſe vnkindneſſes, ought to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me, who haue alwaies carried ſo good a conſcience, as in playing with my fellowes, or others, I neuer med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for money, but for <hi>Pater noster,</hi> and <hi>Aue Maria</hi> onely: and doe ſtedfaſtly beleeue, that this merite alone towards God, ſaued me from the Parliament of Paris, where I was in ſome perill: and I aſſure you, had I beene put to any torture eyther of bodie or mind: (of bodie, being laid on the rack, of mind, by any cenſure of the Church) I had beene quite vndone.</p>
               <p>Thus much did I get out of father <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom I found to be another <hi>Alexander</hi> the great amongſt you Ieſuits, that is, a Prince of an inuincible ſpirit. After I had heard him, I examined the litterall proofes. By your Pleas I learned many things which me thought made very much againſt you. For <hi>Arnauld</hi> and <hi>Dole</hi> charging you, that your Colledge was the Spanyards <hi>Randenous,</hi> wherein they conſulted of the affaires of the holy League: you confeſſe in your aunſwere, that the Embaſſadour <hi>Mendoza,</hi> came thither indeed on holy-daies to heare Maſſe, and that afterward, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:14558:216"/>him, to refraine, for the auoyding of ſuſpition. A friuolous excuſe to my iudgement, for why ſhould you pray him to forbeare that, which at that time, you tooke for a great honour done vnto you (if at leaſt a man may beleeue the common report.) Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, it being by your aduerſaries obiected, that a Father of the Societie, <hi>Odon Pigenat,</hi> was Captaine, and Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of the Sixteene, that commaunded within Paris, not onely ouer the ordinarie Magiſtrate, but ouer the chiefe and ſoueraigne, you confeſſe that article, as well in your Pleas, as in <hi>Montaignes</hi> his booke: marry you ſay withall, it was to temper and moderate their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>At the reading of which two places, all that were preſent fell on laughing, knowing <hi>Pigenat,</hi> euen in thoſe daies when he had ſome ſparke of wiſedome, to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore ouer-caried with heat and choller. Since which time he is growne ſo franticke, that he is kept within a Chamber bound and manacled. In the ſame Plea, I found theſe words. <hi>They ſuppoſe they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued well of the Citie of Paris, in as much as during the whole time of the troubles, they neuer ceaſed to teach their youth, there being at that time no other Colledge in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, whereas thoſe exerciſes were entirely kept.</hi> Will you know the cauſe? (ſaith a man of good ſort ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by) the Principals of other Colledges, had let their hands fall, as bewayling in their ſoules, the miſeries that grew by this rebellion: whereas theſe fellowes, lifted their hands vp to heauen, as thinking they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed conquerers in the matter they had vndertaken. But nothing amazed me ſo much as a letter, which was ſent into Spayne, but intercepted by <hi>Monſeur de Chaſeron,</hi> Gouernour of the Prouince of Bourbon, the bearer whereof was father <hi>Matthew</hi> the Ieſuite. This letter was ſent me to peruſe, and the tenour of it, was as followeth.</p>

                  <hi>Pigenat</hi> was the Superintendent, yet came it out of the Ieſuits ſhop, who were aſwell the compoſers, as the bearers thereof. Compare the date of the letter, which is of the 2. of Nouember, 1591. with the ſauage cruelty vſed the ſame month by thoſe Sixteen, againſt him that was then chiefe Preſident of the Parliament of Paris, and two other perſonages of name, who were attached, and executed all at one inſtant, it will appeare, that in all this buiſines, there was nothing but proceeded from the Ieſuits. If all theſe euidences in writing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions by mouth, doe not yet ſatisfie you, read the booke of <hi>René de la Fon:</hi> you ſhall ſee, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the Ieſuits to haue been the authors, &amp; originals of our laſt troubles, and of the generall ruine of France. But foraſmuch as this Pamphlet is of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to our preſent purpoſe, you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that <hi>Paſquier</hi> in two or three places of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, fortuned to ſay, that the ſect of the Ieſuits, once taking root in France, would bring forth a Seminary of diuiſion, betweene the<note place="margin">n="*" The French, and the Spay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</note> Chriſtian, and the Catholique: &amp; in the end of his pleading, proteſteth, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer this miſery ſhould come to paſſe, yet at the leaſt they that ſhould liue in thoſe daies, ſhould acknowledge, that this age was not vnfurniſht of ſuch, as had long before, as it were from a high Tower, foreſeen the tempeſt to come.</p>
               <p>In the yeere 1597. <hi>Monſieur Marion</hi> the Kings Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the court of Parliament of Paris, pleading againſt the Ieſuits of Lions, recounting the miſchiefes, which this ſect had cauſed, added theſe words. Wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth a notable example of the true predictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which God, when he pleaſeth, inſpireth into thoſe whom he loueth. For the cauſe being ſolemnly pleaded aboue thirtie yeeres agoe, for the admittance, not of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which was neuer approued in Fraunce, but of their Colledge into the bodie, &amp; priuiledges of the Vniue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, the wiſeſt men of that time, hauing indeed a ſingular

But what are theſe Diuine Diuiners (ſaith he) that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, ſo well, ſo truly, ſo effectually of the Ieſuits? Is it not poſſible for vs to diuine at their names, and Diuinations, although our breaſts ſwell not with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſmes of theſe inſpired ſpirits? Is not <hi>Paſquier</hi> one of them? And <hi>Marion</hi> in the prophecies which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, doth he not directy poynt at thoſe which were vttered by <hi>Paſquier?</hi> If I prophecie truly, <hi>Paſquier</hi> his Pleas haue made me a Prophet. This Plea hauing lyen buried for thirtie yeeres, and digged vp againe within theſe three yeeres, like an old Image loaden with newe Pardons, hath like a ridiculous <hi>Paſquill,</hi> ſpoken, and prophecied backward. That which in the yeere 1564. he neither could nor durſt ſay: returning out of hell in the yeere 1594. &amp; 95. better inſtructed in things, which were paſt alredy, he hath pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like an Oracle from the tripode: &amp; from him haue I learnt them. But the miſchiefe wil be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe pleadings ſhalbe one day brought forth in their originall forme, to diſcouer the new Pardons that are paſted vpon this plaſtred <hi>Paſquin,</hi> and when the reward of his prophecies ſhal be branded vpon his backe.</p>
               <p>O mightie and worthie champion, meriting to haue his ſtatue ſet vp in the mids of all your Colledges for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo valiantly hunted, not to couert, but to death, the auncient enemie of your Order; was there euer man, that behaued himſelfe better with his perme, and his wit? Onely this troubleth me, that giuing ſuch a braue onſet vpon this poore old man, he chargeth him at laſt to haue new forged his pleadings, and ſet downe vnder
<pb facs="tcp:14558:219"/>the yeere 1594. in manner of a prophecie thoſe things which he had ſeene come to paſſe through Fraunce, the yeere 1564. whereby this honeſt man doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that all the miſeries of Fraunce haue proceeded from the Ieſuits: for this was the ſcope of <hi>Paſquier</hi> his Plea. And my ſelfe alſo acknowledge, that the holy Ghoſt was minded to ſpeak by the mouth of this Ieſuit.</p>
               <p>O how great is the force of truth, which cannot but break forth, whatſoeuer fig-leaues of cunning, cloaking, or hypocriſie, we apply to couer, or diſguiſe it withall. Then what need haue you, Right Reuerend <hi>Paſquill,</hi> to trouble your braynes, with ſearching ſo many records, to know whether the Ieſuits were the authors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuers of our troubles? There needeth no more, but this confeſſion alone, which cannot be diſauowed by the Generall, and other the Superiours of this Order: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch a ſtatute in the 18. article of the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the third part of their conſtitutions. <hi>Libri edi non poterunt in lucem ſine approbatione atque conſenſu prapoſits Generalis, qui eorum examinationem tribus committat.</hi> No bookes ſhall be publiſhed without the allowance, and conſent of the Generall, who ſhall commit the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof, to three of the order. Be aſſured that in a matter of ſo great importance, all the Ieſuits bookes which haue beene produced before you, were by them publiſhed, and ſet forth by the authoritie and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Generall, or other Superiours by him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed, and aſſigned to that purpoſe. Therefore you may hold for true, all the confeſſions by them made, concerning our troubles, and in eſpeciall, that of <hi>René de la Fon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beleeue as much (aunſwered I to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fellowe) neyther dooth that trouble mee, but that this lewde foole, <hi>La Fon,</hi> vnder the alluſion of two names, ſhould compare <hi>paſquier</hi> to <hi>Paſquin.</hi> In as much as I doe not thinke there liueth that man
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14558:219"/>of what degree ſoeuer, which may enter compariſon with mine Excellencie. It is true that you ſay, (replied the other) but when you once know what this <hi>Paſquier</hi> is, it will not trouble you at all: for he is one, whom the Ieſuits feare more then they loue.</p>
               <p>In concluſion, this was the courſe I tooke, to be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly informed in the firſt poynt of your Accuſation, which concerneth the laſt troubles of Fraunce. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond remaines, which toucheth your violent attempts vpon the perſons of Kings, princes, &amp; other great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, which are in diſlike with your opinions. Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my ſelfe to the enquirie of this poynt, I was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a booke of <hi>Peter Mathew,</hi> one of your Agents, intituled, <hi>Summa ſummorum Pontificum:</hi> who ſpeaking of you (my Maiſters) with all honour and reſpect vſeth theſe words; <hi>Tyrannos aggrediuntur,</hi> they encounter ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. VVhich ſome conſtrued, as ſpoken in hatred of the late King, <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who was ſlaine in 89. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which time, that booke was firſt printed at Lyons. And your Aduerſaries maintained, that theſe vvordes were purpoſely inſerted, after the particide of the ſaid King, whom you were wont to entitle by the name of Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe, your fellowes alledged, as well in their Pleas, as in <hi>Montagnes</hi> his booke, that <hi>Mathew</hi> vvas not of your Order, and that therefore his ſayings ought not to be preiudiciall vnto you. In this controuerſie, I commaunded Signior <hi>Marforie,</hi> to looke ouer the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences fully, and wholly, and to make mee a true and faithfull report thereof. His report was, that indeede <hi>Mathew</hi> was not of the Order of the Ieſuits, but that he ſpeaketh exceeding partially on their behalfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he hath occaſion to talke of them: marry it vvas hard to iudge, whether his booke were publiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or after the death of <hi>Henrie</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>That skilleth not: (ſaith another) for when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
<pb facs="tcp:14558:220"/>them for encountring Kings, he muſt needes meane it, either by the breaking forth of the Troubles, which were at that time wrought againſt the good King, or by the murder committed vppon his perſon. Take it whether way you pleaſe, they cannot cleere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of it, beeing for that poynt by name infinitelie commended by him, who through his whole Booke, dooth countenaunce and grace them all he may.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Ieſuits of Burdeaux, would neuer pray for the late King, as <hi>Montaignes</hi> alſo confeſſeth. And to prooue that <hi>Mathew</hi> maintaineth nothing, but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall poſition of the Ieſuits, I referre you to <hi>The Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes of Confeſſion,</hi> made by Father <hi>Samuell Sa,</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in Diuinitie, one of their Societie, who vnder the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Princeps,</hi> affirmeth, that a King may be depoſed by his ſubiects from his Crowne and dignitie, if he doe not performe the dutie of a king. And vnder the letter <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus:</hi> that the prince, who beareth himſelfe like a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, may be expelled by his ſubiects, albeit they haue ſworne perpetuall obedience and allegeance vnto him, in caſe, after he haue beene admoniſhed, he doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe.</p>
               <p>By this meanes, bringing all ſoueraigne princes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the danger of theyr craftie confeſſions, for them to reſolue ignorant people, who they be, that beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vprightly in their gouernment; the reſt, that doe not ſo, beeing forthwith depriuable. Which poſition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with that of <hi>Mathew,</hi> by them ere-while diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and diſclaimed.</p>
               <p>To ſay truth, I wanted no ſycophants in this vvhole inquitie of the proceſſe againſt you: although I aſſure you, you had ſtout Champions, that very skilfully could ward their blowes. In this meane time, I had ſent mee out of diuers countries, the ſundry arraignments &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls of ſeuerall perſons, who by the inſtigation of Ieſuits, had made, or conſpired to make, attempt vppon the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14558:220"/>liues of princes. Out of England, the triall of <hi>William Parry,</hi> in the yere 1584. and another of <hi>Edward Squire,</hi> in the yeere 1597. Out of the Low-countries, the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls of <hi>Baltazar Girard,</hi> in anno 84, and of <hi>Peter de Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> in 98. Out of Fraunce, the trialls of <hi>Peter Barriere,</hi> in 93, and of <hi>Iohn Chastell,</hi> in 94. Aboue all the reſt, I did moſt relie vpon <hi>Poter Barriere</hi> his proceſſe, wherein I found the whole order to be deeply charged, &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the good Fathers, <hi>Varade</hi> and <hi>Commolet.</hi> Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlie after that, comes me in a huge traine of young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, who, for diſcharge of their conſciences doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that beeing ſchollers in the Ieſuits Colledge, they had nothing elſe preached vnto them, but the murder of the <hi>Biarnois,</hi> (for ſo they termed the King of Fraunce that now raigneth.) In the end, I caſt myne eye vppon <hi>Chastells</hi> proceſſe, which did mightily confirme mee in all that the young youths had reported. For beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the Court of the Parliament of Paris, as touching the murder which hee had attempted vppon the Kings perſon, marke the very words of the Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, and his aunſwers.</p>
               <p>Beeing demaunded, where hee had learnt this newe Diuinitie? (which was to kill Princes) He aunſwered, it was by Philoſophie.</p>
               <p>Beeing demaunded, whether hee had ſtudied Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie in the Colledge of the Ieſuits? Hee aunſwered, yea: and that vnder Father <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eret,</hi> with whom hee had beene two yeeres, and a halfe.</p>
               <p>Being demaunded, whether he had not beene in the chamber of Meditations, into which the Ieſuits vſed to bring the moſt enormous ſinners, to the intent, that in that chamber they might behold the pictures of manie deuils, in diuers terrible ſhapes, vnder pretence to reduce them to a better life, thereby to affright theyr mindes, and incite them, to vndertake ſome great exploit? Hee aunſwered, that hee had beene oftentimes in the ſayd
<pb facs="tcp:14558:221"/>chamber of Meditations.</p>
               <p>Being demaunded, by whom he had beene perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to kill the King? He aunſwered, that he had heard in many places, that it was to be held for a moſt true principle, that it was lawfull to kill the King, and that thoſe who ſaid ſo, called him Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Being demaunded, whether that argument of killing the King, was not ordinarie with the Ieſuits? Hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that hee had heard them ſay, that it was lawfull to kill the King, and that he was out of the Church, and that they ought not to obey him, or hold him for theyr King, vntil ſuch time as he was abſolued by the Pope.</p>
               <p>Againe, beeing demaunded in the great Chamber, (my Lords the Preſidents and Counſellours therof, and of the Tournel being aſſembled) he made the ſame aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, and did in eſpeciall propound &amp; maintaine, that Maxime, that it was lawfull to kill princes, &amp; by name the king that now raigneth, who was not in the church, as he ſaid, becauſe he had not the Popes approbation.</p>
               <p>The truth is, this poore ſeduced fellow, doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deſigne, or note any of your Societie, to haue taught him this damnable leſſon, yet doth hee not ſpare the whole bodie of your Order. And muſing ſomwhat thereat, this controller of your actions, that ſtood neere vnto me, told me, it was a thing not to be wondred at: becauſe the Ieſuits leſſon, when they would procure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prince to be murdered, conſiſted of two braunches: the firſt was, to giue an aſſured promiſe of Paradiſe, to whomſoeer could atchiue this high peece of ſeruice, &amp; that they ſhould not ſpare to kill him, though hee were in a Church in the midſt of diuine ſeruice. The ſecond, that if the partie that ſhould attempt this, were intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and deliuered into the hands of the Magiſtrate, to be made an example, he ought aboue all things to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of diſcouering, or reuealing theyr names, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee vvas ſet on worke, vppon paine of eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:14558:221"/>&amp; certainly, in <hi>Barrieres</hi> proceſſe it appeared, that theſe inſtructions had beene giuen him, albeit, (not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene bred vp in the ſchooles of the Ieſuits, as <hi>Chastell</hi> was) hee did not obſerue them before his Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>After I had examined this proceſſe, I lookt vpon the triall of <hi>Robert, Bruce,</hi> a Scottiſh gentleman, who was appeacht, and accuſed by Father <hi>William Crichton</hi> a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, becauſe he would not procure <hi>Metellinus,</hi> Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to the King of Scots to be murdered. I enquired from whence all theſe tricks of Matchiaueliſme, &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſme might ariſe. Whereupon they ſhewed mee your Conſtitutions, which enioyne you a blinded ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to your Superiours, and with as conſtant reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to follow their commaundements, as if they had iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out of the mouth of our Sauiour Chriſt. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, they bring me <hi>The Aphoriſmes of confeſſion,</hi> made by your <hi>Emanuell Sa,</hi> &amp; a booke compoſed by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall of the Seminarie at Reims, wherein they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that in certaine caſes, it is lawfull for the ſubiect to kill the King.</p>
               <p>But aboue all, Father <hi>Iohn Guignard</hi> his Booke, one of your Prieſts: wherein he laboureth to prooue, as well that the late King. <hi>Henry</hi> the third, was iuſtly ſlaine, as alſo that hee who now raigneth, ought to be ſerued in the ſame manner. The wordes of his booke are theſe. That cruell <hi>Nero,</hi> was ſlaine by one <hi>Clament,</hi> and that counterfet Munke was diſpatched by the hand of a true Munk. This heroicall act; performed by <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> as a gift of the holie Spirit, (ſo termed by our Diuines) is worthilie commended by the Priour of the Iacobins, <hi>Burgoin,</hi> a Confeſſor and Martyr. The Crowne of Fraunce may, and ought to be transferred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the houſe of Bourbon, vnto ſome other: And the <hi>Biarnois,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though conuerted to the Catholick fayth, ſhal be more mildly dealt withall, then he deſerues, if rewarded with
<pb facs="tcp:14558:222"/>a ſhauen crowne, he be ſhut vp into ſome ſtrict Couent, there to doe penance, for the miſchiefes which he hath brought vppon the Realme of Fraunce, and to thanke GOD, that he hath giuen him grace, to acknowledge him before his death. And if without Armes he cannot be depoſed, let men take Armes againſt him, if by war it cannot be accompliſht, let him be murthered.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſcandalous, and if I durſt ſo call them, the blaſphemous words of a booke, ſprinckled with an infinite number of others. In concluſion, I read with all diligence, your Petition made to the King, full of pretie flouriſhes, whereby you condemne all thoſe attempts, as forbidden by all lawes both of God and man.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:14558:222"/>was taken downe, to carrie in ſolemne proceſſion: the ſecond, was when the <hi>Chenalier d' Aumalle,</hi> the night of this Saints feaſt, attempted to ſurpriſe the Towne of Saint <hi>Denys:</hi> the third, when the ſaid ſhrine was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine taken downe in March, anno 1594, and generall proceſſion made, for the withſtanding of the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, all theſe vowes, prayers, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, turned to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion of his enemies. For about Diepe he obtained a famous victorie, beyond all hope or expectation. The <hi>Chenalier d' Aumalle</hi> was ſlaine within the cittie of Saint <hi>Denys,</hi> vvhen hee thought himſelfe Maiſter of it, and all his Companie put to flight. And in concluſion, Paris yeelded vp to the King, within two or three dayes after the taking downe of the ſaid ſhrine. S. <hi>Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All this was brought to my handes, and to ſay truth, the greateſt part of theſe proofes came out of your own Colledges, a large Inuentorie framed as well for you, as againſt you.

<pb facs="tcp:14558:223"/>thereof to ioyne others with me, that were of long experience, and practiſe in theſe matters.

I deliuer the euidences to Signior <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forio,</hi> to be diligently and exactly by him peruſed. Wee prefixed a day for iudgement. Being aſſembled, I made it knowne to the companie, how mightily you founde your ſelues agreeued with this piller, or Pyramis, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a monument, to continue for euer the freſh memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of that which had hapned in Fraunce.

               <p>
                  <hi>Marforio</hi> reporteth the whole proceſſe faithfully, ſhewing himſelfe to be no learner in this trade. Hauing read, and pondered all the euidences on both parts, and proffering in the end to deliuer his opinion firſt, (as is the manner of thoſe, that make report of any cauſe to the Court) I entreated him to forbeare. Let vs giue thys honour (quoth I) to the ſtrangers. We are to ſit in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vppon a Stone, and in my opinion, thys honour is moſt due to Maiſter<note place="margin">n="*" Stone.</note>

               <p>Maiſter <hi>Pierre</hi> needed not much entreatie; for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he ſtood vp, &amp; with a rough kind of ſpeech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14558:223"/>in this manner. How long ſhall theſe lewde Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors freely abuſe our patience? how long ſhall we be ſo ſimple, to ſuffer our ſelues to be abuſe die an it be, that the Ieſuits hauing giuen both fire, &amp; fewell to our laſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, their Colledge at Paris, hauing beene the common retreat of all ſuch, as came into Fraunce, with a reſolute determination to make themſelues Maiſters thereof: their Lectures ſo many trumpets, to encourage their ſchollers to the parricides of Kings, and their principall Agents hauing put weapons into the hands of many deſperate ſoules, to murther our King; can they (I ſay) be ſo ſhameles, as at his hands to craue, that they may be reſtored? This were cunningly, and vnder-hand, to commence proceſſe againſt the ſacred Court of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Paris, which neuer did or that receiue, the leaſt touch of imputation for any ſentence paſſed by her, but onely herein, that in condemning this ſect, ſhe did not ſend all their adherents, which were within Paris, to the gallowes.

The poſſeſſions where with they are indowed in Fraunce is in reſpect eyther of their Monaſteries, (which they call houſes) or of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. In the firſt reſpect, they can enioy none: for
<pb facs="tcp:14558:225"/>their owne ſtatuted forbid it in the fecond much leſſe; becauſe they were neuer receiued, or allowed in Fraunce for true and lawfull Colledges, capable of legacies, and charitable contributions, further then as they promiſed in the aſſembly at Poiſſi 1561. to renounce all their vowes, &amp; to raunge themſelues; (as all other Colledges did) vnder the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their Ordinaries: which they neyther haue, nor would performe ſince that time: and conſequently neyther may, nor ought to be reputed Colledges. If you will returne to the common &amp; aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rules of the Roman law, which we are with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to embrace, (the common lawes of a countrey, being not againſt it) there you ſhall finde, that if a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator bequeath any Legacie to a Colledge, the Legacie is good and ſufficient, if the Colledge be approued by the Magiſtrates: if not, it is to be conuerted to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe and benefit of ſome other Colledge which is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized.</p>

               <p>With this word Maiſter <hi>Pierre dis Coignet</hi> concluded, and was in ſome ſort ſeconded by the <hi>Faster</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion: not for any deepe vnderſtanding that was in him, but for that rule, which is common to men in miſerie, who are much eaſed, when they haue copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their affliction: he alſo would gladly haue ſeene the Ieſuits kept poore, and <hi>Fasting</hi> like himſelfe.

By meanes whereof, <hi>Morforio</hi> after a little altercation began to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>To what purpoſe (ſaith hee) are all thſee cenſures? <hi>Rectè quidem, ſed quorſum quaeſo tam recte?</hi> I ſay not, but they are wiſely handled, but to what end? Here is much good talke ſpent to little purpoſe. You argue the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as if the Ieſuits had now in their hands all thoſe lands, or poſſeſſions, which haue beene by way of almes beſtowed vpon them. I tell you, they are almoſt all ſold, and turned into money. Their money is in diuers banks out of your Realme, to relieue them in a rainie day, in caſe they ſhould be forced to forgoe the countrey of Fraunce. And if at all they haue any certayne reuenew, that conſiſteth wholly in benefices, which they haue cauſed to be vnited to their Colledges, and are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of alienation. Haue they ſold them ſay you? (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Maiſter <hi>Pierre</hi>) by what right could they doe ſo? By authoritie from their Generall onely, which we ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approoue, nor receiue in Fraunce. Our lawes are farre other in that poynt of the ſale, and alienation of poſſeſſions, belonging eyther to the Church, or to Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties in common. In a word all theſe pretended ſales are void in law. Wherat I brake into theſe words. You open a gap, to an inconuenience that would ſpread far, &amp; at one blow, extend to the hurt of a number, who haue no
<pb facs="tcp:14558:226"/>hand at all in this quarrell. Whereby you ſhould bring another Chaos, or confuſion into the countrey of Fraunce, and therefore I referre you to the auncient law of the Romans: <hi>Communis error facit ius.</hi> A common error makes a right. Finally, after much wrangling and contention, it was concluded and agreed amongſt vs, to leaue the matter as we found it, and that both the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratnis and the ſentence of the Parliament, ſhould ſtand without any alteration in eyther. This was all I could obtayne of the companie, and that not without ſome bitter words at litle Maiſter <hi>Pierre</hi> his hand, who tolde me in mine eare, that he ſaw, I was at the poynt to turne Ieſuit, to vphold mine ancient greatnes in the Citie of Rome, with men in higheſt place and authoritie.

Beſeeching you not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme your innocency henceforward, becauſe ſome turn it to a ſcoffe, others to a ſcorne. It is a puddle, which if you did well, you ſhould let reſt; for the more you ſtir it, the more wil your doings ſtink. Your ſelfe are the firſt, and laſt iudge to giue ſentence againſt your Order. I ſpeake to you by name, that are the author of the <hi>Moſt humble Petition to King Henry</hi> the fourth: wherein you acknowledge, that he is more barbarous, then the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians themſelues, who ſetteth himſelfe againſt his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne.

I did expect, you ſhould aske me that queſtion (quoth the Aduocate) and was about to haue entred thereinto of my ſelfe, had you not preuented mee. Thinke it not ſtraunge it ſhould be ſo: it is a myſterie hidden in the ſecret counſell of God, who hath not wholy withdrawn his wrath from vs, but intendeth one day to vſe theſe, as his inſtruments to bring more plagues vpon vs. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, doe not you thinke, but that thoſe other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, haue ſome great ſhew of reaſon for their doings.</p>
               <p>Did you neuer ſee a new Teſtament, wherein the hiſtories were drawne in pictures? In that place of the Goſpell, where our Sauiour is tempted in the deſart, Sathan is pictured in the habit of a Munke. Some <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianists</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:227"/>ſticke not to ſay, that thereby is vnderſtood, that the life and conuerſation of Munks is Diabolicall. But I am of a contrarie opinion. For whoſoeuer the Painter was, that in this matter of the temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, deuiſed to cloth the Diuell in thoſe weeds, he did it not without great conſideration: iudging, that this being the true habit of piety, there was no way more readie &amp; certain to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the conſciences of well meaning men, then by it.</p>
               <p>The Diuel, after he had ſet forth diuers mommeries of religious Orders, he meant, to ſet his reſt vpon this: and (transforming himſelfe into <hi>Ignacius,</hi> and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) to pretend the holy name of Ieſus, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by the mouth of the Ieſuits, not onely terreſtriall kingdomes to Princes, wherewith they would inueſt them, (as Sathan did to our Sauiour) but alſo the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen to ſuch as would execute their malice, againſt thoſe Kings, that were their enemies. Wherein the Diuell hath not much miſſed of his ayme. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this glorious name hath he abuſed and onerreached our Popes their holines, and conſequently a number of religious ſoules. And as himſelfe is the Spirit of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, ſo is it no meruaile if the Ieſuits (his true and lawfull children) enioy the ſame priuiledge, that their father doth. They haue cauſed diuiſion between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and our Prelates of Fraunce, betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and the Vniuerſities, betweene Popes, and Kings, betweene Popes and other Prelats, if now they cauſe a new diſſenſion, amongſt our Parliaments of Fraunce, they haue done that, which onely was wanting to the ful and abſolute accompliſhment of the Sorbones prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, when in her cenſure of the Ieſuits Sect, in the yeere 1554 ſhe ſaith: <hi>Multas in populo querelas, multas lites, diſſidia, contentiones, aemulatioues, variaque ſchiſmata inducit:</hi> It breadeth many quarrels, controuerſies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, contentions, emulations, and many diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people.</p>

               <p>The Parliament of Paris, vpon mature &amp; wiſe delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, hath baniſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of their iuriſdiction. Some other Parliaments doe retaine them, albeit the attemps of <hi>Barriere</hi> and <hi>Chastell</hi> vppon the perſon of the King, be vnto them notoriouſly knowne, and that they were the firſt plotters, and contriuers of our troubles. When I thinke of theſe diſſentions, I am put in minde of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet aunſwere made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the caſe of <hi>Peliſſon,</hi> Preſident of the Parliament of Chamberi, who by the ſentence of the Parliament of Digeon, was depriued of his office, beſides ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſgraces, which he receiued, vpon the complaint, and information of <hi>Tabouè</hi> Atturny generall. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, obtayning Letters for a ſecond examination, and and the cauſe being remoued to the Parliament of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, he was reſtored to his office, and <hi>Tabouè</hi> condemned to make him honourable amends, bare-headed, &amp; in his ſhirt, with a halter about his neck.</p>
               <p>The King beeing informed of theſe proceedings in both the Courts of parliament, wiſely made aunſwer, that he eſteemed all his Iudges to be men of honeſtie &amp; vprightnes: but that they of the parliament of Digeon, had iudged according to their conſciences, and they of Paris, according to right and iuſtice. I make no doubt, but that all the Iudges of other parliaments, are by their conſciences induced thereunto, but this I ſay, that there was neuer any thing decreed in Court, more ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſincerely, then this was by the parliament of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</p>
               <p>The other, as I ſuppoſe, are ſwayed by the authority of the holy Sea, ſupporting the Ieſuits: which is no ſmall aduantage for them to leane vnto: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will oppugne them by the ſame authoritie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching them not to take in euill part this admonition, which in all dutie &amp; humilitie I offer vnto their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, not doubting, but after they haue heard me, (if at
<pb facs="tcp:14558:228"/>leaſt they pleaſe to giue me hearing) they will the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues condemne this their opinion.</p>
               <p>You haue heeretofore vnderſtood, how at two ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times, our Ieſuits had practiſed the murder of the King, and not at that time when hee was deuided from vs in religion, but euen then when he was reconciled to our Church, in the time of a truce, deſiring nothing elſe but a generall vnion, and reconcilement of all his ſubiects throughout the Realme. They are highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured at Rome, as the Iuie, which ſeemeth outwardly to ſuccour the wall, when as inwardly it eateth into it: but if they had euer conſpired any attempt againſt the Popes perſon, I am out of doubt, that by the Decree of that great, and holy Conſiſtorie of Rome, theyr Order would haue beene put downe, and aboliſhed for euer. At the leaſt I haue ſeene the like practiſe in a caſe not vnlike, for a matter not ſo dangerous for example, nor of ſuch conſequence as that, ſhewed vppon the whole Order of the <hi>Humiliati.</hi> I will acquaint you with the hiſtorie.</p>

This good Prelate, perceiuing that the greateſt part of them, gaue themſelues ouer to a voluptuous, and diſſolute kinde of life, tooke in hand to reforme them: which ſome of them tooke in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:14558:228"/>dignitie, as that they vowed his death.</p>
               <p>There was a Guardian of that Order reſident in the Cittie of Verſellis, his name was <hi>Girolano Lignana,</hi> who with certaine other his confederats, vndertakes this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.

Vppon this reſolution they come with a ſteadfaſt purpoſe to ſtrangle him, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the Church at prayer, God diuerted them from executing their malicious purpoſe, by meanes of a certaine iarre, that happened amongſt them: but in ſted thereof, they ſtole diuers peeces of gold, and ſiluer plate, whereof they made mony. This done, <hi>Lignana</hi> goeth to <hi>Donato Facia,</hi> a brother of their order, a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate companion, and altogether ſet vppon miſchiefe, whom he ouercommeth, and corrupteth with monie, to vndertake the murder of the Cardinall <hi>Borrhomaeo.</hi> Hee beeing in this manner ouer-come, like an honeſt man wil not breake his word; but eſpying a time, when this great, &amp; holy perſonage was at prayers in a chappel with his owne familie, he diſchargeth a piſtol vpon him, which by a great miracle, paſſed but through his gown. Within a while after, both hee and <hi>Lignana</hi> are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and beeing manifeſtly conuicted, they are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and therewithall, their Order wholie ſuppreſſed in a full Conſiſtorie at Rome, by <hi>Pius Quintus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ieſuits (as I will heereafter declare) alledge that this was a general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracie of the whole Order againſt <hi>Borrhomaeo.</hi> Wherein they lie impudently: for it cannot be found that euer any man had a hand in the plotting, or contriuing thereof, ſaue onely <hi>Lignana,</hi> Guardian of the Priorie of Saint <hi>Christopher,</hi> in Verſellis, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other priuate Munks. The Order was diſtributed into many other Monaſteries, ſcattered heere and there throughout Italy, who were not of counſell with thys
<pb facs="tcp:14558:229"/>enterpriſe. Yet neuertheleſſe, this onely attempt againſt Cardinall <hi>Borrhomaeo,</hi> though voyde of ſucceſſe, was the chiefe cauſe, that the Order was finally ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>Compare this hiſtorie, with that of the Ieſuits (I ſpeak to the Iudges of other Parliaments) are we not inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie aſhamed, that at Rome there ſhould be ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of iuſtice ſhewen vpon the <hi>Humiliati,</hi> for that one of them made an attempt againſt the life of one onelie Cardinall, whoſe death could be no great preiudice to the whole Colledge of Cardinalls, and that wee ſhould ſuffer this ſect of Ieſuits to liue amongſt vs, which (as our ſelues knowe) hath procured two ſeuerall attempts vpon the perſon of the King, being but one in a whole kingdome, vpon whoſe life depend the generall quiet and welfare of all his ſubiects: beeing the worthieſt prince, that euer raigned in Fraunce, any time theſe 5. hundred yeeres.</p>
               <p>The dignitie of a Cardinall, hath beene very great in Rome, but yet inferiour to a King of Fraunce, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his owne kingdome. For in Rome there be many Cardinals, but in France there is but one King. Among all the Cardinalls, I haue euer honoured the memory of Cardinall <hi>Borrhomaeo,</hi> but yet I cannot conceiue howe the loſſe of him ſhould be of ſo fatall conſequence to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie, as the death of our great King to Fraunce. Nay further, (howe euer I may be cenſured ouer-partially preiudicate againſt the Ieſuits) ſith by the laſt confeſſion of <hi>Barriere,</hi> there are challenged three other. Religious perſons of Lyons, one a Carmelite, another a Iacobin, and a third a Capuchin; notwithſtanding (ſay our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, in their foure Bookes publiſht ſince the laſt Arreſt of Parliament) wee muſt puniſh the particuler offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not cenſure the whole Order.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment ſhould be proportioned to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The offence beeing perſonall, the puniſhment ſhould be ſo to, and not inflicted vppon the Order. I
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14558:229"/>will not here ſay, that ſuch proceedings, as elſe where are iniuſtice in affaires of State, may be auowed for iuſt, and that in the decimations which were anciently made among the ſouldiours, when there was queſtion to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a Regiment, as ſoone died the faultleſſe as the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender: and yet was there neuer any exemplary iuſtice more agreeable to gouernment, nor more neceſſary for the maintenaunce of a Common-wealth. Much leſſe will I ſay with the great <hi>Tacitus, Habet aliquidex iniquo omne magnum exemplum, quod in ſingulos vtilitate publica rependitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not heere alledge the opinion of one of the greateſt Lawyers in Rome, who was wont to ſay, That in caſes of ſedition, the firſt executions ſhould be verie ſharpe: Afterward, when thinges were well appeaſed, the Magiſtrate might ſlacke his hand, and growe more milde. I will not now heape vp all the rules &amp; axiomes ſeruing to this purpoſe, although that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the life of a King, and the dependencie thereof, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth no example, nor cannot well be compared with any other. And howſoeuer ſome Romane <hi>Manlius</hi> may be of opinion, that a whole body or corporation, ſhould be liable to the perſonal attempt of any of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, eſpecially in an attempt againſt the life of theyr king; yet ſo it is, as hetherto Fraunce hath not receiued thys poſition. As it was manifeſt in <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> Iacobin, who although hee murdred our king, yet proceeded they not againſt the Order of the Iacobins, but onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and his Prior, who was torne in peeces with foure horſes in Tours, after hee was diſcouered to haue beene his principall counſeller.</p>
               <p>Now, if there were but ſome few in the ſect of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, traded in this miſterie of treaſon, it were happilie ſufficient to puniſh the particuler offender: but the vow of treaſon is as familiar with them, as theyr other foure. That this is thus, we ſhall need no further proofe
<pb facs="tcp:14558:230"/>then the tragedie of <hi>Barriere,</hi> wherein you ſhall finde ſuch a packe, as beſides the particulers mentioned in the Inditement, it cannot be auoyded but the whole bodie of theyr ſect, was therein much engaged. I ſawe of one ſide, a Ieſuit in Lyons, verie deepe in the practiſe. I ſaw the murtherer, not well reſolued in his attempt, come purpoſely to Paris to learne his leſſon. But where dyd they beſtow <hi>Aubri,</hi> Curat of Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> of Arts, one of the moſt ſeditious of all their troope? Happilie they ſent him to the Iacobins, in regard of the miſchance which fell out vnder the other gouernment. Or to the Carmelites would they ſend him, or to the Capuchins rather? Nothing leſſe, for hee was not aſſured, that in theyr Monaſteries, murther, eſpecially the murther of a King, would be approoued.</p>
               <p>Whether then? Marrie he ſendeth him to them, who were great Maiſters in this Art: to the houſe of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, where he knew the reſort of the curſed crew to be. Ieſuits, who knew by the modell of confeſſions framed, to make ſtrange Geometricall proportions of ſinnes &amp; merrits. That to kill a king of Fraunce, there might bee a ſinne <hi>Ad quatuor:</hi> But to kill him with an intention to inueſt the king of Spayne in his kingdome, it were a merrit <hi>Ad octo.</hi> So as the merrit ſo much ſurpaſſing the ſinne, the murther was not onely tollerable, but iuſt and lawfull.</p>
               <p>This Curat, was he in this troope? No. For <hi>Barriere</hi> found one <hi>Varade</hi> Rector of their Colledge, who was of old acquainted with theſe courſes. Hee found like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe one <hi>Commolet,</hi> who ſecretly ſubſcribed to <hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rnauld</hi> firſt of all in the yeere 1594. <hi>Marion</hi> the Kings Attorney ſince, in 97. declare, that the Order of the <hi>Humiliati,</hi> was in our time ſuppreſſed for leſſe cauſe then the Ieſuits deſerue to be. The one and the other, in few words. This is the poſition I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Let vs ſee how the Ieſuits will ward this blow. <hi>Montaignes</hi> writing againſt <hi>Arnauld</hi> ſayth.<note place="margin">Montaig. ca. 59.</note> To ſtrengthen your weake aſſertion, you bring the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Order of the <hi>Humiliati,</hi> which were ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Italy: You are farre wide, the caſes are nothing alike. The cauſes of their ſuppreſſion are mentioned in the Bull, namely, that they were irrigular, imperious, and incorrigible. They conſpired againſt their Prelat, their Protector and reformer: and the executor of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie being taken, diſcouered the reſt, who likewiſe confeſſed the fact. You cannot affirme the ſame of the Ieſuits, could you, it is like you would not ſpare them. I am of the Ieſuits mind, they are nothing like indeed. For the queſtion was there but of a Prelat, wherof there is plentie; here of a King, of which fort we had no more, who is Gods true annoynted. The conſpirator of the <hi>Humiliati</hi> was puniſhed as ſoone as he was taken: the Ieſuit was not, for after they had brought him backe from Paris (as to them nothing is impoſſible) they found meanes for his eſcape. In truth this defence of <hi>Montaignes</hi> is full of preuarication, and therefore <hi>La Fon</hi> denieth it. Concerning the <hi>Humiliati,</hi> (ſaith hee) it hath beene anſwered heretofore by <hi>Francis Montaignes,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:232"/>that they were ſenſual &amp; licentious, vnlearned, irregular, without diſcipline, ſcandalous, whoſe houſes were Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Pallaces, their chambers garniſhed like Kings Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites. Their Cloiſters &amp; Galleries, full of laſciuious pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Their Prouoſt keeping a publique Curtiſan, &amp; all the reſt, of the Prouoſts diet. In the end, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict of treaſonable practiſe againſt the perſon of their Prelate, the Cardinall <hi>Borrhomeo,</hi> a man of verie holy life, labouring by all meanes to reclayme them. Their cauſe was exactly heard, the crimes examined, debated, and iudged by our holy Father the Pope, to whom the cogniſance of ſuch cauſesproperly belongeth; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned them not to depart out of Italy, but to liue confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder other religious, as Pentioners depriued of their poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, of whom ſome liue at this day in Milan. And hereof all Millan is witneſſe, togither with the Bull thereof likewiſe extant. My purpoſe was to haue made a compariſon betwixt the <hi>Humiliati</hi> &amp; the Ieſuits, therby to ſhow, that there is much more reaſon to ſuppreſſe the Ieſuits now, then there was cauſe then to diſſolue the <hi>Humiliati.</hi> But the impudencie of this laſt Ieſuit preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me to encounter him before I paſſe any further. What a ſtrange comment is this he maketh vpon his fellow <hi>Montaignes?</hi> Where findeth he either in <hi>Montaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> or in the Bull, thoſe crimes which he mentioneth? where findeth he this ſame conſpiracie in perſon againſt the Cardinal <hi>Borrhomaeo?</hi> where findeth he the Prouoſts Curtiſan? was there but one Prouoſt in this order? Had not euery Priory one? Had this Prouoſt no name? It is an vſe the Ieſuit hath gotten, when hee begins to tell tales, he leaues not till he haue told twentie. But to bring him to the touch. Let vs ſee the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> it wil eaſily appeare, whether his allegations be Alchimie, or no.</p>

                     <p>AS a carefull Father ouer that ſonne whom he hath brought vp verie tenderly, deſirous to reclayme him, when he is ſtept out of the way of his ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, firſt exhorts him, fauours him, pardons him, rebukes him, moreouer, ceaſeth not to trie one thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, vntil he attayne vnto that which he deſired, &amp; hauing at laſt made proofe of all, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſees nothing will do him good, vtterly deſpayring of his recouerie, caſtes off the affection of a Father, and thruſtes him out of doores, iudging him vnwoorthie to bee his heire: So the Biſhoppe of Rome, whom the Diuine Maieſtie hath appoynted to bee a Father and Paſtor of all the Religious orders in his Church, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any of theſe holy Companies ſwarue from the rule and preſcription of life they haue vndertaken, endeauours ſometime by admonition, ſometime by correction, to reſtore their ouncient inſtitution, or at leaſt, by ſome kinde of amendment, bring them in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order: After he hath ſought euerie thing that may make for their good, when hee ſeeth them loath all wholeſome remedies, and ſtubbornely goe on ſtill in the way of wickedneſſe, and perceiueth them to grow worſe and worſe, ſo that they may ſooner bee broken then bended, careleſſe of all cure, hee determineth to remooue them, leaſt the power of an inueterate and vntamed euill, ouer-runne others, and deſtroy them. VVhich thing (becauſe wee are earneſt in this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14558:236"/>poynt) both in many others, and eſpecially in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the <hi>Humiliati,</hi> wee haue beene very carefull of, leauing nothing vnattempted, but finding many flawes in them, if not altogether, yet in ſome conuenient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and moderation, they might by little and little, be faſhioned to their firſt inſtitution. For, after that our beloued Sonne <hi>Charles,</hi> of the title <hi>ſanctae Praxedis,</hi> Prieſt, Cardinall <hi>Borrhomaeus,</hi> Protector of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Delegat of the Apoſtolique Sea, of late per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the ſayde Friers to breake out into Riot, had prouidently ſet downe many things, concerning the manner of Gods worſhip, obedience, &amp; common life, and of the manner of receiuing and education of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons. We vnderſtood, that they vtterly deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both thoſe, and all other rules of their owne Order, and liued very voluptuouſly, &amp; that theyr Gouernours, together with ſuch as had any offices in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their affaires, wickedly waſted a great part of the reuenewes (as if they had beene their owne) in worldlie vanities and filrhines, and committed an innumerable ſort of ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>VVee endeuouring to cut off all thoſe meanes that did caſt them into ſo apparant dangers and inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, tooke order for many things hurtfull to their life and manners, and proptietie of theyr rule and Order, and for the manner and time of gouernment in euerie ones commaundement, and alſo for the menaging their goods, &amp; diſpoſing of their reuenewes: and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and offices, very profitable to repaire the ruines of this decayed ſtate and regular diſcipline, hoping that theſe things would in time to come, bring good ſucceſſe to the ſayd Order. But the enemie of all good things reſiſting, almoſt all of them (becauſe they had beene too much inured to eaſe &amp; idlenes) deteſting to liue in order and to be amended, howſoeuer by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they outwardly accepted our lawes and precepts,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:237"/>yet vnderhand they deuiſed all the wayes they could to ſuppreſſe them. They held wicked conſpiracies ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, they ſtird vp theyr kindred and others of the Laitie that were mightie, to ſedition; they ſent theyr Brokers and Agents, to the moſt intrinſecall ſeruaunts of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Princes, to draw them by great rewards and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to worke vs by the foreſayd Princes meanes, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe that wee had done, and many others did they by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill practiſes attempt to this purpoſe, that they might continue theyr filthie and wicked courſe of life, &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the deadly pleaſures of this world, among whom was one that fell more high &amp; headlong from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Fayth to Hereticks, and declined to theyr im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious opinions.</p>
                     <p>Vnderſtanding of theſe things, we found them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Impenitencie, the greateſt ſinne of all, who beeing ſo often reproued, ſtraue to continue in the ſame obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie, not thinking it enough to haue attempted theſe things, vnleſſe they contriued the deſtruction of ſuch as were of authoritie among them, and chiefely did watch diligently ouer theyr owne ſoules, prouoked heereunto by him, who not contenting himſelfe vvith plunging of <hi>Iudas</hi> into the grieuous ſinne of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, procured him alſo by mony to betray his Maiſter. For by the inticement of of this wicked ſpirit, <hi>Hierom Lignana,</hi> once Preſident of the houſe of Saint <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> at Verſelles, and many other confederats of thys order, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiring the death of <hi>Charles</hi> the Cardinal theyr Protector, that they might haue mony, to compaſſe this hainous act, they held a conuenticle, to murder firſt our beloued ſonne <hi>Fabius Simoneta,</hi> a brother of the ſayd Order, Treaſurer of the reuenewes of <hi>Breda</hi> at Millan, thinking to furniſh themſelues, with ſuch coyne as was in his keeping: thence determined they to goe to the Church of the ſayd houſe, to ſtrangle him there, as hee was at his prayers, but (by Gods mercie) diſagreeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14558:237"/>themſelues, about the manner of the aſſault, they deſiſted from that, and changing their minds, they ſtole away the ſacred gylt veſſels of the Church. Which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecretly ſold, or pawnd, the ſaid <hi>Hierom</hi> hyred one <hi>Donatus Fazia,</hi> one of his brotherhoode, an Apoſtata, to murder <hi>Charles</hi> the Cardinall, and hee hauing ſpyed his time &amp; place, finding him at his prayers (as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was) with his familie in a Chappell in the euening ſhot of a piſtoll at him to ſtrike him through, but diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of his purpoſe, ſome of the bullets were defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his garments while he prayed, others, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the blow, ſtucke in the next on eyther ſide of him: the innocent by Gods grace was preſerued: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both of them, with others that were pertakers of this fact, were afterward beheaded.</p>
                     <p>Thus when we ſaw this company growne vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the Church of God, liue in no order, ſhewe no ſigne of amendement, infected with ſo grieuous crimes, defiled with ſo cruell ſacriledge, and furthermore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and incorrigible, beeing out of all hope of their recouerie, we haue at laſt determined to roote them out, like an euill tree that carries very badde fruit. Hauing therefore thoroughly deliberated with our Brethren, by theyr aduiſe, and by the abſolute authoritie committed to vs, we vtterly extinguiſh and aboliſh the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſaid Friers <hi>Humiliats,</hi> the place of theyr Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and Prouincials, and all other offices of theyr Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus ſuppreſſed, and alſo all, and all manner of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuts, cuſtoms, and decrees of the ſame, howſoeuer they haue beene eſtabliſhed by any oath, or confirmation A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall, or any other warrant, and alſo all priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and graunts, both generall &amp; ſpeciall, the tenors of all which, as if they were word for word heere inſerted, in theſe preſents we hold them for expreſſed, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſtile or forme they beare, confirmd with other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and clauſes that may moue vs: And wee depriue

And we take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them all power and authoritie, to hold from hence-foorth, any Generall, Prouinciall, or other Chapters. Yet wee ordaine, that all the Bretheren now remaining, which haue made their regular profeſſion, be from henceforth ſeated in ſuch houſes and places, as wee ſhall appoynt, with things neceſſary for their maintenaunce: that there they may liue according to theyr rule &amp; profeſſion, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cure and viſitation of the Ordinaries of thoſe places, or of ſome others, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall appoynt for that purpoſe; or elſe, that according to the direction of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, they may goe to theyr equalls, or to ſome of ſtraighter order alreadie allowed.</p>
                     <p>As for the Nouices &amp; others whatſoeuer not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, their habit puld ouer theyr eares, let them be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the houſe and company of the profeſſed. Which profeſſed, we preciſely commaund, &amp; forbid, that from hence-forth they neuer admit vnto theyr profeſſion or habite, any of them that are expelled, or any other that would be deuoted to it: Neither ſhall they receiue or purchaſe anie newe houſes or places, if they doe, the profeſſion ſhall be voyd, and ſhall binde no man, not ſo much as in generall ſo profeſſed. All erections of ſuch like new houſes, ſhall be of no force, and they that ſhall doe contrarie, ſhall thereby incurre the ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication: from which none, vnleſſe it be vpon the poynt of death, ſhall be abſolued, without the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14558:238"/>licence of the Biſhop of Rome.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, purpoſing to prouide with all ſpeede for the ſeruice of God, and the Miniſters of his church, we reſerue by the foreſaid depriuation, all commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, dignities, adminiſtrations, offices, and other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall benefices, with cure &amp; without cure, which be hereafter ſecular, to the holy Sea, in their vacancie. And alſo the houſes, Couents, places, houſhold ſtuffe, goods, fruits, ſubſtances, actions, and foreſaid rights, &amp; their proprietie and dominion, ſpecially and expreſly to the free diſpoſiton of our ſaid Sea. Decreeing that to be voyd and of none effeſt, whatſoeuer ſhall happen to be wittingly or vnwittingly attempted to the contrarie, by the foreſaid Friers or any other.</p>
                     <p>And we will, that the tranſcript of theſe preſents, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnder the hand of a publique Notarie, and ſealed by the ſeale of an Eccleſiaſticall perſon of dignitie, ſhall be as autenticall, in, or out of iudgment, whereſoeuer they be drawne, as if theſe preſents were exhibited and ſhewen.

Giuen at Rome in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Pallace, in the yeere of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of our Lord, 1577, in the Ides of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the ſixt yeere of our Pontificalitie.</p>
                     <p>This is the Bull at large, the which I tooke out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeus Toſcanus,</hi> in his booke intituled, <hi>Summa consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionum, &amp; rerum in Eccleſia Romana gestarum à Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorio nono vſque ad Sixtum quintum.</hi> This fellow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides is a great friend of the Ieſuits. But what gather you out of this Bull? that the <hi>Humiliati</hi> were licentious, but no mention of the particulers deuiſed by <hi>La Fon.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in expreſſe termes, that by their plots and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they ſtirred vp troubles and ſeditions among Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>In occulto.</hi> The words are, <hi>neceſſarios ſuos &amp; alios po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiores, ad intestinas ſeditiones concitarunt.</hi> And I pray you, are not our reuerend Ieſuits heerein theyr crafts Maiſters?</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:14558:239"/>
                     <p>Further, you finde not in this Bull, that the Order of the <hi>Humiliati</hi> were at any time aſſembled to lay violent hands vpon the Cardinall <hi>Borrhomaeo,</hi> theyr Reformer, as the Ieſuits ſuggeſt. If it had beene a rout or an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie in perſon, it could not haue beene auoyded, but their Generall, the Prouincialls of their Order, and the Priors of their Monaſteries, muſt haue beene of the conſpiracie, or at the leaſt ſome part of them. A clauſe which would not haue beene forgotten in the Decree that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, &amp; the holy Conſiſtorie of Rome ſent out, hauing ſo great intention finallie to ſuppreſſe them.</p>
                     <p>And this is the reaſon the Ieſuits haue layed this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation moſt falſely vppon all the Order, who had in Chapter (as they ſay) conſpired againſt <hi>Borrhomeo.</hi> Let vs acknowledge a truth like the children of Chriſt, and not like the diſciples of <hi>Ignacius.</hi> This Order vvas growne very infamous, by reaſon of their incontinency and licentious life, the which the good Cardinall <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhomaeo</hi> would haue helpt if it had beene poſſible. This was (I muſt confeſſe) a fault, and that verie foule and ſcandalous, &amp; yet for this, it is like they ſhould not haue beene ſuppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>It is a vice whereunto naturally wee are prone. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that hee who would ſuppreſſe all houſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion where this vice aboundeth, eſpecially thoſe which are ſeated in places farre from reſort, wee may ſay with <hi>Tacitus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t antea vitijs ita tum demu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> legibus laboraremus.</hi> And there might be peraduenture more ſcandale in ſuppreſſing, then in winking at theyr vices.</p>
                     <p>How then? What cauſed the ſuppreſſion? It vvas GODS will, that vnexpectedly, <hi>Lignana,</hi> Pryor of Verſellis, and ſome others, angry with this new refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, conſpired againſt <hi>Borrhomaeo,</hi> as it is expreſſed in the Bull. And this ryot was the cauſe of the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and this is the cauſe the Bull dooth recount theyr
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14558:239"/>diſorders in generall, but ſpecially theyr attempt againſt <hi>Borrhomaeo.</hi> The which is ſet downe verie particularlie, and not the incontinencies which <hi>La Fon</hi> reciteth.</p>
                     <p>VVhat is there in this ſtorie, but will fit the Ieſuits as well as if it were made for them? They are notorious throughout the world, for the troubles raiſed by them in Fraunce. And as manifeſt it is, that they practiſed and bargained with a ſtranger, to bring in a newe King into this kingdome. The deteſtable fact of <hi>Barriere.</hi> The howlings of <hi>Commolet</hi> to the people, to kill the King euen in the time of the truce. The people vvith one mouth, from the youngeſt to the moſt aged, cried ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them, ſo ſoone as the King reentred Paris. The cauſe was pleaded in the name of the Vniuerſitie, and as it falleth out oftentimes, that in matter of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the cauſe is of conſequence, while we feare to be negligent, wee growe ouer-curious: ſo heere the cauſe was referred to counſaill. GOD would ſo haue it, that <hi>Chastell,</hi> a diſciple of the Ieſuits, poyſoned vvith theyr damnable poſitions, wounded the King with a knife, and beeing taken, hee maintained in the open face of iuſtice, that hee might doe it lawfully.</p>
                     <p>The haynouſnes of thys fact, aggrauated with other circumſtances, gaue occaſion of the pronouncing the proceſſe againſt the whole Order. Nowe I pray you tell mee, if the ſame holie Ghoſt, which wrought in the ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Humiliati,</hi> had not a ſtroke likewiſe in driuing the Ieſuits out of Paris? They are the ſame things, the ſame proceedings, vnder ſeuerall names. Theyr difference is in theſe two poynts. The one, that the <hi>Humiliati,</hi> in being too ſubiect to their pleaſure, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet committed ſuch a ſinne as our corrupt nature teacheth vs: but the Ieſuits, beeing the principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of the troubles wherein two hundred thouſand loſt theyr liues; haue ſinned againſt GOD, &amp; againſt nature. For nature abhorres nothing more then death,
<pb facs="tcp:14558:240"/>which is ſo cheape among the Ieſuits, to the loſſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The other difference is, that the attempt of <hi>Ligna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was but againſt a Cardinall, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I acknowledge wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to be one of the holieſt men our age yeeldeth: A Cardinall, whom the Colledge would be loth to ſpare, yet notwithſtanding hee liues, and liueth in as great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation as euer hee did. Whereas the attempt of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell,</hi> endangered a King, ſole in his kingdome, &amp; ſuch a king, as the world muſt yeeld to bee as valiant, wiſe, and curteous, as anie before him; and by whoſe death, if the treaſon had ſorted to effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee were to expect nothing but horrour and confuſion, our olde inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. And yet they muſt be cherriſhed in ſome part of the kingdome. But becauſe ſome not remembring, or not obſeruing things paſt, others not foreſeeing, leſſe laboring to preuent dangers to come, ſuffer themſelues to be abuſed by them, accounting them the Champions and protectors of the Catholick faith, I wil make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vnto you, that their ſect is as dangerous as <hi>Martin Luthers,</hi> &amp; that there is nothing the Pope hath more to feare, as preiudiciall to his authority and greatnes, then their Generall, what ſhowes and proteſtations ſoeuer they make to the contrary notwithſtanding.</p>

               <p>There ſucceeded him, <hi>Ignactius Loyhola,</hi> ſome yeeres after, who by a contrarie courſe, defended the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the holy Sea, but after ſuch a faſhion, as hee no leſſe endamaged our Church then theirs.

I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a friend of mine being at a Sermon, rather for nouelty then deuotion, a Miniſter cryed out to his diſciples; My brethren, ſaith hee, God hath beheld vs with a mercifull eye: Although <hi>Martin Luther</hi> had beene ſufficient to giue the Pope battell: yet ſo it is that <hi>Ignacius Loyhola</hi> is come beſides to ayde vs. For hee cunningly, vnder colour of ſupport, ſupplanteth him. What readier meane to ouerthrow a State, then faction and inteſtine quarrels. And I pray you what other milke giue theſe Ieſuits in the Church of Rome? Then ſith this Sect is his laſt refuge, &amp; his principal ſupport, be of good cheere the day is ours. For without queſtion the head muſt be verie daungerouſly ſick, if for cure therof, fauouring this new Sect, they vtterly ouerthrow the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts. But what ſhould be the cauſe of this diſorder? An imaginarie vow of Miſſion, in fauoure whereof the Pope pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Theſe ſixe or ſeuen Latine wordes vttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Sea are blaſphemous. But this is the vnbridled licence of theſe new Preachers, who when
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:14558:241"/>they are tranſported with their prepoſterous zeale, may ſay any thing. This diſſenſion concerned not the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: it had beene his part to touch the conſcience of euerie good Catholique, who deſireth to liue and die in the boſome of the Catholique Apoſtolique and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church: yet it ſhould be our care, that theſe my Maiſters the Miniſters inſult not ouer vs, &amp; that their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs be not grounded on the Ieſuits. Conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they haue cauſe to ſay thus or no, for among other particulars of the cenſure of our Diuines, in the yeere 1554. this was, one, that the Ieſuits would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Seminaries of Schiſme, and diuiſion in our Chriſtian Church, &amp; that they were rather brought in, for the ruine and deſolation of it then for the edification thereof. Wherfore, if I may be thought to erre in ſaying that the Sect of the Ieſuits is no leſſe preiudiciall to the Church then that of the Lutherans, I doe it not without iudgement, hauing for my warrant heerein, the cenſure of that venerable facultie of Diuines in Paris.</p>

For although they made ſhew to vowe like obedence to the holy Sea, &amp; vnder this proteſtation they were authorized in Rome, yet is it manifeſt, that they do yeeld more obedience to their Generall, then to the Pope.</p>
               <p>I ſay not onely to their Generall, but to all their other Superiors, as their Prouincials and Rectors, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in their vow of Miſſion, their Generall hath more commaund ouer them then the Pope: euen all, as I haue more particularly diſcourſed, ſpeaking aſwell of the vow of Miſſion, as of the blinded or hoodwinckt obedience. Therfore I conclude, &amp; concluding ſhal not be withſtood by any man, which is not verie paſſionatly partiall, that the commaund which the Pope and the Generall haue ouer the Ieſuits, is in all points ſoueraigne and abſolute; but without compariſon, more preciſe in the things which concerne the General. Which maketh mee beleeue, that if euer the holy Sea receiued a breach, there is no Sect liker to make it, then this of the Ieſuit, their General reſiding in Rome. We exclaime againſts
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14558:243"/>the Lutherans, and not without cauſe, inaſmuch as they were the firſt in our age that troubled the peace of the Church. Notwithſtanding, I hold not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence then the Ieſuits. Some childiſh or young ſcholler, will not ſticke to ſay perhaps, that in maintayning this poſition, I am an heretique. All thoſe whom we terme in Fraunce of the pretended Religion, of the Reformed, or of the new, haue no head ouer them: If they ſhould admit any, they ſhould contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelues, denying the Popes primacie, and yet receiuing another. They liue in an Oligarchy, or an Ariſtocracy. Inſomuch as he, who for his knowledge or antiquity, hath any preheminence ouer the other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, it is an inherent authoritie for time of life, not tranſmiſſible from him to his Succeſſors. Beſides, they want outward ceremonies, without the which, Religion worketh not eaſily in the hearts of ſimple people. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them is held a great miniſter, who neuer read ouer but <hi>Caluins</hi> Inſtitutions, or <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places, and ſome other moderne writers. So as I doubt not, but this Sect in time will fall of it ſelfe, as I thinke it had beene downe ere this time, if the vnhappie ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ieſuits, had not ſo factiouſly withſtood the wiſe deſignes of our deceaſed King. I know this is not a ſtile greatly to content the Miniſters, neyther doe I affect their fauour: all my ambition is, to ſee our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Apoſtolique Roman Church in that dignitie, and diſcipline, wherein it flouriſhed in the dayes of our fore-fathers. For concluſion, our Kings being Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques as they muſt be, if they will raigne, I feare not the Hugonote in Fraunce, who whether he will or no, ſhall be brought in vnder obedience well ynough.</p>
               <p>But I feare the Ieſuit aboue all, not onely in Fraunce, but in Rome, becauſe their pollicy tendeth to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a tyranny ouer all, which they will recouer by little and little, if they be not preuented. They haue
<pb facs="tcp:14558:244"/>a Generall which is not annuall, or for terme, as thoſe of the Friers: But perpetuall, as the Popes. Some one will ſay, that the like is in the chartre houſe, I agree, but they are recluſe &amp; lead a ſolitary life in their Cloyſters, ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred from trafficke and entercourſe with the world. Some will reply, that there are diuers heads of Orders, as of <hi>Clugni, Premonstre,</hi> and <hi>Grammond,</hi> which are for terme of life, I graunt it, but yet they haue Statutes and Decrees inuiolable within which they are limited and confined, ſo that they can do nothing preiuditiall to the reſt of the Religious.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo with the Ieſuits, for they haue nothing ſo certaine as the vncertaintie of their conſtitutions. The which they can change in their Chapters without crauing ayde of the holy Sea: yea, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall himſelfe, in ordinarie affayres of his owne abſolute authoritie, may doe his pleaſure. Euerie man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that a perpetuall Magiſtrate is more abſolute then a temporary. In the firſt general congregation which was held by them, in the yeere 1558. Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the fourth, ſent to them purpoſely the Cardinall <hi>Pacochus,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe them his pleaſure was, that their Generall ſhould be choſen for certain yeers, foreſeeing the extraordinary greatnes which he might grow vnto by this perpetuall regency: Notwithſtanding, ouercome with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, he was in a ſort content, yet ſent he the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Taruenſe,</hi> to ſignifie, that he held it more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient to be temporarie, then perpetuall.</p>
               <p>This Generall, beeing thus perpetuall, yet are all the dignities of his Order temporary. Vnder him are the Prouincialls, according to the deuiſion of Prouinces: vnder them are the Rectors, who haue particuler au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer theyr houſes and Colledges; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ouer theyr Fathers, &amp; ouer the Coaiutors, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall; &amp; ouer the ſchollers elected: For the heads of Colledges, they are principally appointed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14558:244"/>to be Superintendems of the ſtranger ſchollers. Theſe offices hold vſually for three yeeres together, yet may they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued or abridged at the pleaſure of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: he diſpoſeth of the temporalties abſolutly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſent, and exerciſeth a world of prerogatiues, which are not permitted to our Biſhops. I will deliuer you euery particuler in his place.</p>
               <p>The Prouincialls are their Biſhops, the Rectors are their Curats: as we likewiſe call in Languedoc, Rectors, thoſe which in all other parts of Fraunce are called Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats. None of theſe I haue named are perpetuall, but at the will of their Generall. No other dignitie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, is comparable with that of our holy Father, and yet his compared with the Generalls, is leſſe. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his holineſſe hath confirmd a Biſhoprick, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promotion, his hands are bound, he cannot diſplace them of his owne abſolute authoritie; they are not Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants at will, as the Prouincials &amp; Rectors Ieſuits. Our holy Father, by the ancient Cannons and conſtitutions, cannot giue power to Biſhops and Abbots, to alienate their temporalties, without ſpeciall cogniſance of the cauſe. There is required an eſpeciall aſſemblie to giue aduiſe, and after conſent obtained, one preſenteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Superior, who appointeth a Proctor for the Church, to ſee if ſuch alienation be neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>Theyr Generall may ſell, morgage, allienate, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the goods of the Church, and is not accountable when he hath doone. And that which is a tyrannie, the like whereof was neuer heard, hauing deputed ſuch as ſhall pleaſe him to make his ſales, he may fruſtrate and diſanull any act of theirs, although they haue not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the limits of their commiſſion. Our holy Father aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth no ſuch authoritie, to permit ſuch as haue vowed Chaſtitie, Pouertie, or Obedience, to recouer theyr poſſeſſions, much leſſe to marry, except Kings &amp; ſouerainge Princes, and that in caſes of very vrgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.
<pb facs="tcp:14558:245"/>The cleane contrarie is practized by the Ieſuits in their firſt vow, which they call the ſimple vow: is not this, to attribute more to theyr Generall, then our holie Father will aſſume?</p>
               <p>I told you yeſterday, that in matter of Miſſions, the Generall may ſend all vnder him, whether hee will, not onely of the laſt vowe, but of the firſt and the ſecond. This you may finde in the ninth part of their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, chap. 3. Artic. 9. Heere I deſire to knowe from whence hee deriueth this power, for from the holy Sea he hath it not: ſearch all the Bulls of their Order. Well I know, that in that of 49, of <hi>Paul</hi> the third, it is lawfull for the Generall to ſend as well as the Pope, into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers countries for the propagation of our fayth. But this clauſe is to be vnderſtood of Fathers, in the laſt ſolemne vow: for the miſſion of the holy Sea extendeth onely to them. Then this muſt proceede from ſome particular dutie the other Ieſuits owe vnto theyr Generall. But where is that? For neither in their ſimple vow, nor in theyr firſt ſolemne vow, they binde themſelues, eyther to the Pope or their Generall to the vow of Miſſion, but onely to the three ſubſtantiall vowes of other religious Orders. Where then is this bond, where lieth this dutie hid? I belieue, in the tyrannie of their Generall, and in their blinded obedience. And that which is ſtrange, this ſame blinded obedience, is by all them promiſed and ſworne vnto the Pope, yet doth hee not exerciſe it, but vppon the Fathers of the great and the laſt vow onely. Whence ſpringeth this diuerſitie? the reaſon is at hand. In a vvorde, our holy Father hath not ſo much power ouer the Ieſuits, as their Generall, whom theyr ſoueraine Pope, and in their irregular gouernment, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ours but for faſhion ſake.</p>
               <p>Let vs goe a little further, &amp; looke a little into their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behauiours. They ſay they are ſubiect to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the holy Sea, I rather think they impoſe lawes
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14558:245"/>vpon it. That ſo it is, before the Bull of the yeere 1540, firſt foundation of their Order, they exerciſed of theyr owne authority their aſſemblies, in the Charter houſe of Paris, they opened ſince theyr ſhops to all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the permiſſion they obtained in the yeere 1561, they exerciſed fortie and foure yeeres their ſimple vow, which is contrarie to all the conſtitutions of the church, before <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. had giuen a ſafe conduit. And as they wrought our Popes ſtill to ſecond theyr greatnes, ſo this ſame remiſſnes &amp; relenting of the holy Sea, hath giuen meanes to theyr Generall, to equall himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>Let vs conſider our holy Father the Pope ordained of GOD, ſuch as he is when hee is choſen by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The Cardinalls bow themſelues before him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and kiſſe his handes. I thinke this honour is proper to his holines.<note place="margin">Part. 8. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. cap. 6. art. 6.</note> The Generall of the Ieſuits hath the ſelfe ſame kneeling, and hand-kiſſing when hee is choſen. And yet I will not wrong him, for I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that in ſome Monaſteries, this likewiſe is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſpecially in publique ceremonies: but to take this homage of others, it is inexcuſable.</p>
               <p>I will goe no further for an example then Father <hi>Claudius Aquauiua</hi> their preſent Generall. After that he was choſen in the yeere 1581, and after all his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers had done their homage, and he had taken his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Inde pater</hi> ſaith the firſt of their Letters annuall for that yeere, <hi>cubiculum aſcendens, eo die ſalutanti turbae om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis generis hominum, exoſculandas manus praebuit.</hi> Which is to ſay; After that the Father had taken his Chamber, hee offered his handes to kiſſe to all manner of perſons which came to ſalute him. What newe idolatrie is this? Is not this to erect a newe Pope in Rome, triumphant ouer the true &amp; auncient?</p>
               <p>We haue in our Church but one head, whom we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be about all other Prelats, the Vicar of
<pb facs="tcp:14558:246"/>God. The Generall of the Ieſuits arrogats the ſame title. In al the vowes which the Ieſuits make before him, they terme him Gods Lieuetenant:<note place="margin">Part. 5. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. cap. 3 &amp; part. 6. cap. 1</note> betwixt Lieuetenant &amp; Vicar, the difference is ſo nice, that I ſee none. And in one place of their Conſtitutions, the gloſſe made by a Ieſuit, termeth him expreſly Gods Vicar. Nay they are ſo ſhameleſſe,<note place="margin">Gl. part. 4 Conſt cap. 3.</note> that they are not content their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhould aſſume this ſtate, but forſooth theyr Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours may exact likewiſe of their inferiours. <hi>Omnibus iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem commendatum ſit vt multum reuerentiae, &amp; praecipuè in interiore hominis,</hi>

                  <hi>Memores eos qui hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalitatem amant, Christum in hoſpitibus recipere.</hi> That is to ſay, that they remember to be hoſpitals to the poore, for entertaining them, they entertained Ieſus Chriſt. Words vttered to excite charitie, not to builde an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme, which the Ieſuits ſeeme to ground vpon theſe wordes, that they ſhould acknowledge Ieſus Chriſt in their Generall, as <hi>Iohn Leiden,</hi> the king of Anabaptiſts, gaue out of himſelfe, and would haue had others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it. But becauſe already I haue heereof diſcourſed at large, I will nowe content my ſelfe onely to tell you this, that their Generall, taking vpon him the authority of Gods Vicar, hath brought in a ſchiſme and deuiſion betwixt our holy Father the Pope and him.</p>
               <p>And although to maintaine this authoritie, <hi>Montag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> &amp; his ſuffragans, ayde him with all the places aboue alledged, they breede withall their cunning another ſchiſme, of more dangerous effect then that: for that Emperours, Kings, and Iudges, may euery one vſurpe the ſame ſtate. And ſo at vnawares, wee ſhall ſlippe into the hereſie of the Lutherans, who would equall Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops to our holy Father, whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in their ſeuerall iuriſdictions, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Vicars of God: and yet they take not this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vpon them neither, though wee yeeld it them, it is a title which belongeth onely to the Pope, a title which
<pb facs="tcp:14558:247"/>no honeſt and faithfull Chriſtian can denie him, and whereof he may be iuſtly iealous, if any endeuour to rob him of it.</p>
               <p>But whether wander we? There is none but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they are in their ſeuerall charges, the true crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and deputies of God, and that ſuch, ſince the time of the Apoſtles, downe to this day they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued. There is none likewiſe but knoweth, that the Ieſuits are the Popes creatures: if any ſhould aſſume this title, the Biſhops haue moſt intereſt to challenge it, yet they take it not vpon them, but modeſtly leaue it to our holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Ieſuit, who deriueth his reputation from him, will hee be thus immodeſt? By the Counſell of Trent, ſo much renowned in Rome, there are many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, whereby the Biſhoppes are reſtrained of many things, the which our French Church thinketh to be grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on ordinary right; yet is it ſo orderd, that they may be knowne to be Vicars vnder the holy Sea: and yet ſhall vvee permit, that theſe vnderminders of our Church, ſhall vſurpe authoritie as immediate Vicars of God, and not as Vicars of the holie Sea?</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that ordinarilie, we giue the terme of moſt Reuerend to our Cardinalls, &amp; to thoſe which are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces moſt illuſtrious. Their generall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſtorie hath not the title of moſt illuſtrious: as we ſee in the great Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt <hi>Nauarre, Aduertendum est,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>quod per ſolam geſtionem habitus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Naua. com. de reg. num. 76.</note> 
                  <hi>per vnum, vel plures annos, in illustriſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo ſocietatis Ieſu ordine, non videtur fieri profeſſio tacita.</hi> You muſt conſider (ſaith he) that by wearing the habit onely for one or more yeeres, in the moſt famous order of the ſocietie of Ieſus, a man is not thought to make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nauarre</hi> liued in Rome vnder <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13, &amp; did more honour to his hypocrits, then we doe to the great &amp; venerable Conſiſtorie of Cardinals, which are Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailers in ordinarie to the holy Sea. Writing to Biſhops,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:14558:247"/>we entitle them, Reuerend Fathers in God, and thinke herein we honour them ſufficiently: there is no Father Ieſuit of the great vowe, who hath not this title of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. The Letter written to the king of Spayne in the troubles, by our Sixteene Tygers of Paris, ſpeaking of Father <hi>Mathew</hi> a Ieſuit, termes him in three ſeuerall places, the Reuerend Father <hi>Mathew.</hi> And in a great part of the Booke, there be added to the mention of his name theſe two Letters <hi>R. P.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we ſpeake vnto our holy Father, we ſay, Your Holineſſe; when you ſpeake to the Generall, or other Superiour of this Order, yea but vnto the meaneſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongſt the Ieſuits, he taketh his greatneſſe much wronged, if you vſe not this terme, Your Reuerence: yet wee muſt ſay, they encroche not vpon the authorie of the holie ſeate. But why ſhould they not impeach the authoritie of his holines, ſith they vſurpe and inſult vpon Chriſt himſelfe, vnto whom onely, our Chriſtian Church permitteth Apoſtles? Yet ſuffers the Generall his, in ſome places, to be called Apoſtles. This is not to turne our holie Father out of his ſeate, but to put Ieſus Chriſt out of his throne. This is not to be Gods Vicar, but to belieue that he is God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iſmaell,</hi> afterwards called the Sophi, about the yeere 1503, attempted, by putting the Eaſterne parts in combuſtion, to ouerthrow the Eſtate; by that means to equal himſelfe with the <hi>Othomans,</hi> Emperors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, he began firſt to alter and trouble the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> pretending that hee would reduce it to a farre better paſſe; alledging that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> who neuer tooke vppon him higher title then the Prophet of GOD, had a brother called <hi>Hali,</hi> vvho brought in vnder the Banner of his Brother, a Religion more auſtere, whereof <hi>Iſmaell</hi> tooke vppon him to be the Reſtorer. And vnder thys plauſible pretext, hee made himſelfe to bee called a Prophet as well as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14558:248"/>altered the auncient forme of Turban among his owne people, inſomuch as they beganne to adore him as the true Image of God, and reſolutly to follow his aduertiſements. So that he aſſembled at the firſt a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of men, after, added to them multitudes, and ſhortly after, like another new <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſo encreaſed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that he was followed with ſixe hundred thouſand men, both horſe and foote, making the Eaſt to tremble. And in theſe his proceedings, ſo mingling religion with ſtate, conquered a great part of the Country, which his poſterity enioyeth, vnder the great &amp; redoubted name of Sophi.</p>
               <p>The compariſons ſute not in euerie particuler, but if it pleaſe you to conſider what hath paſſed, and is now in practiſe among our Ieſuits, you ſhall find they follow the ſame ſteps in Chriſtianiſme, which <hi>Iſmaell</hi> firſt trode in Mahumetiſme. Their prophet <hi>Iſmaell</hi> is the great <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> who with his fabulous viſions, would beare the world in hand, that ſometimes hee ſpake with GOD. ſometimes with Chriſt, ſometimes with our Ladie, or Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> And as <hi>Iſmaell</hi> fetched out of <hi>Hali,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Brother of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a new branch of Religion, taken from the old ſtocke: So <hi>Ignatius,</hi> chriſtning him ſelfe with this new name of a Ieſuit, in ſted of the name of a Chriſtian authorized fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles, buildeth vp a religion neuer auncientlie obſerued by our Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſmaell,</hi> vnder this new vowe, changed the auncient Turban: <hi>Ignatius</hi> inducing a new Monachiſme amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs, yet retaineth not the auncient habite of Munks. <hi>Iſmaell</hi> firſt aſſembled a handfull of people, after rayſed millions: <hi>Ignatius</hi> doth the like. <hi>Iſmaell,</hi> to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe great, mingled pollicie and religion together; hath not <hi>Ignatius</hi> followed him? <hi>Iſmaell</hi> and his ſucceſſours, were adorned and magnified by their followers: <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> hath been ſo idolatrized, and the reſt of his ſucceſſors in the Generalſhip. But they goe beyond him, for the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:14558:248"/>Generall of the Ieſuits, will not only be honoured by his followers, but by thoſe which are not of his ſect, though happily ſomwhat tainted with his ſuperſtitious hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. <hi>Iſmael</hi> made himſelfe be called the Prophet of God: The Generall termeth himſelfe Gods Vicar. In all theſe proceedings and practiſes, <hi>Iſmael</hi> troubled and tormoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Mahometical ſtate: And ſhall not we miſtruſt in Rome this ſame new Ieſuited <hi>Sophi?</hi> Whoſoeuer ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them not, is no true and legitimate child of the holy Sea. I pray you obſerue a little their encreaſing and their growth. The Ieſuits at the firſt beginning, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be ſome threeſcore in number; ſome three yeeres after, they kept open houſe, come who would and welcome: which was an anticipation preiudiciall to Ordinaries and Vniuerſities, to Kings and their kingdomes. In the end they were not content to equall themſelues with Biſhops in their Dioceſſe, vſurping their iuriſdiction, but exacted more obedience ouer their followers, then the Pope ouer vs. And although there can be no certaine iudgement giuen of future things, yet I dare ſay, &amp; it is true, that in matter of State, the predictions of good or ill, are no leſſe infallible then iudgements Mathematicall.</p>
               <p>Toward the declining of the popular ſtate in Rome, there grew a ciuill warre in Fraunce, betwixt two great factions, the Sequanois and the Heduans, which diuerſly aſpyred to the chiefe gouernment. The Heduans, confederate with the Romans, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their ayde, <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> who from his cradle ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer brooked ſmall attempts, obtayned the command of the French, aſwell on this ſide the mountaynes, as beyond, for fiue yeeres. Beſides, there were giuen him foure legions of ſouldiers, paied by the State. He, as he was a man of great leading, and verie valiant, ſoone brought his affaires to ſuch a paſſe, that pretending to ſuccour the Heduans, he made the Gaules tributary
<pb facs="tcp:14558:249"/>to the people of Rome. In regard whereof, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his friends, he obtayned great priuiledges. As for one, he obtayned that <hi>Pompey,</hi> or his kinſman, might be vndertaker generall, who beſides the bond of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, might doe much in fauouring of <hi>Caeſars</hi> greatnes. Hee was of great place in the Towne, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently verie much followed. Wiſe <hi>Cato</hi> the Vticen, ſeeing how theſe things were carried, often tolde him verie earneſtly, hee would ouerthrow the ſtate ere he were aware, by teaching <hi>Caeſar</hi> to play the Tyrant, which he ſhould finde when it was too late. His prediction came to paſſe: for after much ciuill warre, the Empyre fell to his family. I wiſh to God I might be a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p>But when I conſider ſeriouſly the hiſtory of our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, I am full of feare and penſiuenes. <hi>Martin Luther</hi> directly oppoſed himſelfe againſt the holy Sea. The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, cunning ſtateſmen, couer no leſſe ambition vnder their long caſſocks, then <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and proffer to ſupport the Popedome, but with a propoſition of new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as if I durſt I would ſay, that they make vp a third religion betwixt the true Catholique and the Lutheran. <hi>Caeſar</hi> vanquiſhed the French: theſe if we wil beleeue it, ſubdued a part of the Indies with their prattle, but yet vnder the fauour of the Kings of Portugall, in places where he had command. For, as for our wandring ſoules I do not ſee they had done any great ſeruice in reducing them to the fold. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in regard of his victories, obtaind of the State, many extraordinarie priuiledges, not before imparted to any: The Ieſuits in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penſe of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie conqueſts, in vnknowne countries, haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many priuiledges of the holy Sea, neuer hertofore graunted to them. <hi>Cato</hi> cried out, that the priuiledges giuen to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> would ouerthrow the common-wealth: The great facultie of Diuines in Paris, declared in the yeere 1554. that this Sect would become the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14558:249"/>deſolation and ruine of our Church. And ſome diuining ſpirits, foretold long before, the tragedies they ſhould act in Fraunce. <hi>Caeſar</hi> chaunged the popular State into a Tyrannie: what the Ieſuits will attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Church, is in the hand of God; yet one thing comforteth me, that this great Sea, is builded vpon a ſurer foundation then the Romane common-wealth. Only this I wil adde, that euen as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt lodged his Diuinitie in a humane body for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo long as our Prelates harbour holines and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie in their hearts, all will goe well with them and vs. But when they ſhall fall once a brewing, mingling cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and pollicie with Religion, thereby thinking to maintaine their greatnes, then will they ouerthrow them ſelues and our whole Church.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue hetherto vnderſtood, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Machiaueliſms, &amp; Anabaptiſmes of the Sect of Ieſuits, the treaſons, the troubles they haue brought to France, &amp; wherſoeuer elſe they haue remaind: it is now time to ſound retreat. And yet before I do it, we muſt haue a little skirmiſh with the reeſtabliſhment by them procured, againſt the proceſſe of the Parliament at Paris, giuen rather by God his iuſt iudgement then by men. Now in this new purſuit, hee which ſhall obſerue the time, wherein they beganne to remoue, and the authoritie of him whom they imploy, ſhall find them cunning and worldly wiſe, rather then religious. I cannot tell whether in the end they wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
<pb facs="tcp:14558:250"/>or no: For to ſpeake truly, importunitie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance, their two principall vertues haue great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage ouer the French, which are naturally without gaule when they are flattered. I aſſure you, the annals of the Ieſuit <hi>Magius</hi> their Deligate, giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue to vſe all the faire promiſes that may be, till they become owners of their deſire, then they may caſſiere their promiſes, when they can doe them no further ſeruice. And that this is their practiſe, I can verifie by infinite inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They were vowed to GOD as they ſay, in the Church of Mont-Marter, in the yeere 1534. and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to goe to Ieruſalem, to conuert the Turks to the Catholique Religion. And to this purpoſe, they came to Venice in the yeere 1537. reſolute to take their iourney, after they had receiued the bleſſing of Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third, by whom they were well receiued by the mediation of ſome who brought them thether, and there they receiued money for the voyage.</p>
               <p>Nothing hindred their enterpriſe, ſaue only the fauour of ſome Lords, with whom they grew acquainted in Rome, by whoſe meanes they hoped to ſet vp an eaſier Sect, excuſing the breach of their vow, vnder pretenſe that the paſſage was ſtopt, by reaſon of the wars betwixt the Turke and the Venetian. Yet certaine it was, that the verie yeere of their approbation, which was in the yeere 1540. there was not onely truce betwixt the Turke and the Venetian, but a firme peace. What then altered their reſolution? Marrie euen their eaſe, and ſome other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes they had at home.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Church of Mont-Marter, they ſwore to vndertake the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt of loſt ſoules after they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Doctors of Diuinitie. That was a promiſe made before the face of God, very wiſe &amp; reaſonable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, beſides ther ſynceritie of conſcience, there was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required ſoundnes of iudgement &amp; knowledge, to conuert the Infidels. When they found a better bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:14558:250"/>at Rome, they remembred to forget their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Theſe two firſt aſſayes, made them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Maiſters in matter of deceit &amp; trechery, vpon all occaſions that were offered them for the aduancement of their deſignes. In the aſſembly of Poiſſy, the yeere 1561. they promiſed to renounce their vowes, and to ſubmit themſelues to the ordinarie diſcipline of other Colledges. A promiſe which afterward they renewed in open Parliament. Whereupon they were admitted, onely vnder the title of the Colledge of Clairmont in Paris. Notwithſtanding, in the ſame yeere, they obtaynd Buls of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, altogether contrarie and derogatory to all the ancient priuiledges of our Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. In 64. when they preferred a petition to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to be matriculated or incorporated into the Vniuerſity, forgetting the decree of the French Church confirmed by proceſſe, they entitled themſelues <hi>the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of Ieſus,</hi> an order forbidden them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paſquier,</hi> hauing at the firſt beginning of the cauſe obiected, that the title they tooke vpon them, diſabled their petition, they denied themſelues by the meanes of <hi>Verſoris</hi> their owne Aduocate, auouching, that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the fault of <hi>Pons Congordon,</hi> who was their firſt principall ſoliciter in the cauſe: inſomuch, that <hi>Congor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> was driuen to deny himſelfe. In Rome they obey the holy Sea in all things by a blinde obedience, as I haue ſhowed you by their conſtitutions: In Fraunce (if you beleeue it) by the vow of Miſſion onely, as you may find in their defence made in 94. for the Colledge of Clairmont, and by <hi>Montaignes</hi> his booke, and by the humble petition exhibited to the King by a nameleſſe Ieſuit. In Rome they acknowledge the Popeto be Lord ſpirituall and temporall ouer all Chriſtian Princes: Elſe they muſt directly contradict all the extrauagant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals which impoſe the ſame vpon all Monarchies. It is a propoſition verie familiar in the Cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of
<pb facs="tcp:14558:251"/>Rome. And in the Buls appoynted for the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iubily, in the yeere 1600. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> are called Princes of the earth. In Fraunce they are of another opinion, for in their pleading in the yeere 94. and in the booke of <hi>Montaignes,</hi> they giue out, that the Pope, hath no title to temporalties, but ſuch as he hath by long ſucceſſion of time gotten in Italy. <hi>Ribadinere</hi> in the life of <hi>Ignace,</hi> acknowledgeth, that all their order prayed particularly for the health of the deceaſed King of Spayne: now read their bookes, they know nothing but this particularity, yet pray they generally for all Princes, vnder whoſe protection they haue built their neſtes. In the verie heat of our troubles, there was no Cardinall ſo much withſtood the Duke of Neuers, and the Marqueſſe of Piſani, ſent by the King to his Holines, as the Cardinall of Toledo, a Ieſuit, the troubles drawing to an end, none was ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as he, to further our affayres.</p>
               <p>During our laſt troubles none did ſo much michiefe as they, if you credit men of great integrity &amp; reputation, who were beholders of their tragedies. Read their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble requeſt and remonſtrance preferred to the King, there is nothing which this poore innocent people hath in greater deteſtation, then that which they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo much adored. This is called among chiefe Pragmaticall fellowes, a fayre pretence for a foule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit. They neuer made queſtion to mingle their holy deuotions with affaires of State, as they made vs feele to our payne. Seeing our troubles vpon the poynt of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing, and the Kings affayres ſucceſſefull and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they called in <hi>anno,</hi> 39. a general aſſembly in Rome, wherin it was forbidden, that any of them ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle, yet they did it. But wil you haue a better and more euident example then this? If you will beleeue them, there is nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they abhore more then the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots Religion, inaſmuch as they inhibit their bookes,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14558:251"/>of what argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſoeuer, forbidding expreſly their ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to read them. Oh holy men! Notwithſtanding, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they preſented their requeſt to the king, to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, they choſe a Hugonot to be their ſpokſeman, that by this retaining him, they might be aſſured not to haue him againſt them. Theſe are ſtateſ-men &amp; temporiſers, who hold all things honeſt and lawfull, which ſerue their turne.

A verie fit compariſon for them, for no more then the Camelion can they borrow the colour of white, which in holy ſcripture figureth vertue &amp; inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. A little before the King entred Paris, Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Hays,</hi> a Scot, ſeeing the affayres of the League very much decline, it was his chaunce to diſgorge out of the aboundance of his heart, theſe words in a great audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the Colledge of Clairmont, where hee read the principall lecture; Hetherto to (ſaith he) we haue beene Spaniards, but now we are conſtrained to be French: it is all one, we muſt formalize vntill a fitter ſeaſon. <hi>Ceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum erit tempori.</hi> Theſe were the words he vſed.</p>
               <p>And that you may not thinke that this Maxime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the pliantnes of their conſciences, which they reſtraine or extend, as beſt fitteth their profit, their good Father <hi>Ignace,</hi> firſt taught them this diſpenſation, whereof ſince; they haue made a particular conſtitution. The other holy Fathers, founders of diuers orders of
<pb facs="tcp:14558:252"/>Religion, eſtabliſhed diuers ordinances which they faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if I may ſo ſpeake, with nailes of Diamond in tombs of braſſe, which ſhould perpetually be obſerued by their Munks and other Religious. In the Sect of Ieſuits, there is nothing ſo certaine as their vncertaintie, as I ſaid of late. In the Bull of Pope <hi>Paule</hi> the third, it is written as followeth.</p>

I haue tranſlated this place word for word, and yet when the Bull ſaith in Latine, that the conſtitutions may be chaunged as ſhall be fit for the Societie, it muſt be vnderſtood, for the maintenance and aduancement of the Order.

All lyes, trecheries, and fraudes, change theyr propertie, and become holy thinges, when they
<pb facs="tcp:14558:254"/>make for the aduauncement of their Sect. GOD hath twice miraculouſly preſerued our King from their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, it is not due to his wiſedome &amp; fore-ſight, how ſo euer verie great: he oweth it to God his diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter increaſe of bleſſings hee hath receiued, the more ought he to acknowledge it in all humilitie.</p>
               <p>My Maiſters the Ieſuits, matchleſſe for importunity, vſe the authoritie of ſome great perſonages, hoping to recouer intereſt in the King, notwithſtanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Parliament, graunted out againſt them in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.

He who in Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall moſt idolatrized this Sect, was the King <hi>Sebastian,</hi> whom the Ieſuits, his principall fauourits, counſailed to vndertake the conqueſt of another kingdome, where the oppinion is he was ſlaine in the battaile, yet he could not be found amongſt the dead.

                  </gap>ie, if he there miſcarried, the body of a King ſhould want his buriall, but more lamentable, if he liue, as the brute is, that he is not acknowledge.</p>
               <p>It fell out much otherwiſe to our great King <hi>Henrie,</hi> for ſo ſoone as he had driuen the Ieſuits our of his good towne and Parliament of Paris, God ſent him a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall peace aſwell within his kingdome as without, and as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14558:254"/>proſperous ſucceſſe in all his affaires as he could deſire. Theſe are no faigned, or imaginarie, examples which I place before your eyes, they are generally knowen, and there is none but may eaſily iudge, why this miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune befell the one, and this bleſſing fell to the other. In this moſt humble requeſt, not fained, as the Petion of the nameleſſe Ieſuit, conſiſteth the ſumme of my deſire, and GOD graunt my diſcourſe may haue acceſſe vnto him.</p>
               <p>I deſire heerein, hee could be pleaſed to followe the counſaile of the great Conſiſtorie of Rome, againſt the order of the <hi>Humiliati,</hi> who after they were once ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, were neuer after reſtored, although theyr of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was much leſſe againſt the holy Sea, then this of the Ieſuits againſt his Maieſtie: aſſuring you my Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that there is nothing doth more ſolicite me to this quarrell againſt them, then the generall peace of our Fraunce, and heerein I appeale to God, before whom I doe truly and ſincerely ſpeake.</p>
               <p>The Aduocate, hauing ended his diſcourſe, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of men are variable and vncertaine, ſo were wee diuerſly affected with that which was by him deliuered, ſome, grieued with the Anatomie made of their order, others, much meruailing, neuer imagining there had beene ſo much ſhame and abhomination among them, others, very angry, that with ſuch vnreſtrained libertie, they haue beene ſuffered to range in many parts of Fraunce vncontrouled: beeing abſolutely of opinion, that there was nothing neere ſo great cauſe to ſuppreſſe the Templers, as to ſuppreſſe theſe Ieſuits.</p>
               <p>Whereuppon the Ieſuit, for the honour which hee ought to his Faction, ſaid vnto the Aduocate; I cannot tell wherein you haue been wronged by our companie, and know as little what hope of reward hath hired you to this combat; but well I wot, you haue no ſmall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that make head againſt you, and that you muſt cut
<pb facs="tcp:14558:255"/>off an infinite number of heads, (which is almoſt a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impoſſible) before you can well come vnto the head. Conſider that our company is a venerable Senate, like vnto that which was in Rome in the time of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> to whom his Embaſſadours reported at theyr returne, that they had ſeene as many Kings as Senators. They vvere wont to call thoſe auncient Senators, Fathers, ſo call we ours: and as they were the ſinewes of auncient Rome, ſo are theſe of the newe, I meane of the Papacie, which farre paſſeth the vaine greatnes of the olde Romans. Therefore before they attempt againſt vs, let them be verie well aduiſed: remember what hapned to <hi>Minos</hi> King of Creet, for his buſines with the Athenians. It was there I looked for you, quoth the Aduocate, for your Companie is not the Senate you ſpeake of, but a Monſter, which hath farre more heads then a Hydra, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the which I will be another French <hi>Hercules,</hi> to maule and maſſacre them. Yet one boone I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of you, that when you returne to Rome, you would report to your Generall, as I know you will, all you haue heard diſcourſed, and would vouchſafe the rather (at my inſtance) to preſent him with theſe foure verſes, the which I ſend him in the nature of a Cartell of defiance.</p>

               <p>Euerie one then beganne to ſmile, and eſpecially the Gentleman ſaid vnto him: I will not ſuffer you to goe any further, it is time to cry hola, I will ſtoppe your mouth, dinner ſhall decide your difference. And if you will doe me the honour to belieue mee, all which hath betherto been ſaid, ſhall be wrapt vp in the cloth: The

Preſently one couerd the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and after dinner, our horſes beeing made readie, we thanked the Gentleman for his entertainement, and he likewiſe thanked vs for the honour he ſaid we did him.</p>
               <p>We were ſome ſixe in companie, whereof hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Aduocate, pretending he was to pay him the arrerage of his long abſence.
